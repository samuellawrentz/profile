It is similar to a computed property in other frameworks, such as Vue.js or Knockout.js. Computed variables are created using hooks like ",r.createElement(t.a,{href:"https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/mastering-memoization-usememo"},"useMemo")," or useCallback, and their value is only recomputed when their dependencies change. This allows for a more efficient rendering process, since the component doesn't need to re-render every time a state variable changes, but only when the computed variable changes. In other words, computed variables act as a kind of pit stop, where the component can swap out a slow state variable for a speedy computed one.
