React.memo is a higher order component that helps prevent unnecessary re-renders. It does a shallow comparison of the previous and current props and re-renders the component only if the props have changed.

Here is an example of how to use React.memo:

```javascript
const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
  /* render using props */
});
```

In this example, `MyComponent` will only re-render if the props have changed. This can be highly beneficial for performance optimization, especially when dealing with larger components or lists.

However, it's important to note that React.memo only does a shallow comparison, so it might not work as expected with complex objects or arrays. In such cases, you might need to implement a custom comparison function.

```javascript
const MyComponent = React.memo(
  function MyComponent(props) {
    /* render using props */
  },
  (prevProps, nextProps) => {
    // return true if passing nextProps would return
    // the same result as passing prevProps, otherwise return false
  }
);
``` 

Remember, judicious use of React.memo can greatly enhance the performance of your React applications.
