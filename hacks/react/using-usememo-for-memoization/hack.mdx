In React, you can utilize useMemo for memoization, a technique for optimizing speed by storing costly function call results and reusing them when identical inputs occur. 

```javascript
import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

function MyComponent({ values }) {
  const sortedValues = useMemo(() => {
    return values.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  }, [values]);

  return <div>{sortedValues}</div>
}
```

In this component, `useMemo` is used to cache the sorted `values` array. The second argument to `useMemo` is an array of dependencies. The memoized value is only recalculated when one of these dependencies changes. 

By using `useMemo`, we ensure the expensive `sort` operation is not performed unless `values` changes. This can greatly improve performance in large applications where unnecessary re-rendering can cause lag. 

Remember, `useMemo` should only be used when dealing with expensive computations as adding it unnecessarily can lead to performance degradation.
