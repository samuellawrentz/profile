React is an incredibly powerful JavaScript library, renowned for its efficient handling of state through mechanisms like `useState`. But did you know there are ways to make it even more efficient? Let's delve into an effective trick to optimize performance while using `useState` in your React applications.

```javascript
const [state, setState] = React.useState(initialState);
```

In normal circumstances, React re-renders the component every time state changes. However, sometimes, this isn't necessary. For example, if the new state is the same as the current state, a re-render can be avoided.

A common way to prevent unnecessary re-renders is to use a function inside `setState`. This function receives the previous state as an argument and returns the new state. Only if the returned state is different from the current state will React trigger a re-render.

```javascript
setState(prevState => {
  if (prevState === newState) {
    return prevState; // No re-render occurs
  }

  return newState; // Re-render occurs
});
```

This approach is particularly useful when dealing with complex state objects or arrays. It not only prevents unnecessary re-renders but also makes the code more readable and maintainable. 

To get a deeper understanding of state management in React, refer to [this post](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/setting-initial-state-with-usestate) about setting initial state with `useState`. Also, learn about computed state in React in [this post](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/computed-state-in-react).

Remember, as the famous computer scientist Donald Knuth once said, "Premature optimization is the root of all evil". It's important to understand when and where to optimize. Not all use cases require this level of efficiency. But when they do, this trick can be a game-changer!

In the world of software engineering, it's often the small tweaks and tricks that make a big difference. Keep exploring, keep learning!
