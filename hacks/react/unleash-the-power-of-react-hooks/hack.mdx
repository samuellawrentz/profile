React Hooks were introduced in React 16.8, offering a new way to handle state and side-effects in your React components. They enable you to leverage state and other React features without having to write a class. 

```javascript
  import React, { useState } from 'react';
  
  const Example = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
```

In the above example, `useState` is a Hook. The `useState` hook lets you add state to functional components. In classes, the state is always an object, and you can store any data type in them. With the `useState` Hook, you can work with a single value like a number or string, not just objects.

React Hooks also include `useEffect`, a powerful way to perform side-effects in your application. It serves the same purpose as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in React classes, but unified into a single API.

```javascript
  import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
  
  const Example = () => {
    useEffect(() => {
      document.title = `Updated title`;
    });
  
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Check the document title.</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
```

In the example above, the `useEffect` hook updates the document's title after React updates the DOM. This behavior is similar to what happens in the `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method in class components.

React Hooks provide a more direct API to the React concepts you already know: props, state, context, refs, and lifecycle. They don’t fundamentally change how React works, but they do make your React code cleaner and easier to read.

As the saying goes, “Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript." So, why not make it more efficient, readable, and manageable with React Hooks?
