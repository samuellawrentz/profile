In React, lazy loading with Suspense can be a game changer for web app performance. It allows you to defer loading components until they're needed, enhancing user experience.

To start, import `Suspense` and `lazy` from React:

```javascript
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';
```

Declare your lazily loaded component:

```javascript
const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));
```

Wrap the `LazyComponent` with `Suspense` and provide a fallback UI:

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <LazyComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the `LazyComponent` will only be loaded when it's rendered. Until then, the fallback UI ("Loading...") will be displayed.

Remember to place the `Suspense` component high enough in your component tree to capture all components you want to lazily load.
