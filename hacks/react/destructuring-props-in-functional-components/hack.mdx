Destructuring in JavaScript helps us write cleaner code by allowing us to extract multiple properties from an object or array in a single statement. In React, we use destructuring in functional components to handle props.

Here's how you might do it without destructuring:

```javascript
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```
Now, let's use destructuring to achieve the same result:

```javascript
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
}
```
In the second example, we're destructuring `name` directly from the props. This allows us to use `name` directly in the component, making our code cleaner and easier to read.

Remember, when using destructuring with functional components, you can destructure as many props as you need in the function parameters. This will make your code efficient and clean.
