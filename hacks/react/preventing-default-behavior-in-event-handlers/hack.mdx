In React, browser-based events often come with default behaviors. For instance, a form submission reloads the page by default. To prevent this, we can use the `event.preventDefault()` method. 

Consider a form submission event:

```jsx
class Form extends React.Component {
  handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    // handle logic here
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    )
  }
}
```

In the example above, `event.preventDefault()` stops the default browser behavior of reloading the page on form submission. Instead, the `handleSubmit` function is executed.

Remember, not all event handlers have default actions. For those that do, `event.preventDefault()` can be a useful tool to control the behavior of your React app.
