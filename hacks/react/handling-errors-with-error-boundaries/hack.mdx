React Error Boundaries provide a way to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in a component's child tree, log these errors, and display a fallback UI. They catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and constructors of the child tree.

Here's a basic example of an Error Boundary:

```javascript
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
    logErrorToMyService(error, info);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // You can render any custom fallback UI
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }

    return this.props.children; 
  }
}
```

You can use it as a regular component:

```javascript
<ErrorBoundary>
  <MyWidget />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

If `MyWidget` throws an error during rendering, the Error Boundary will catch it, display a fallback UI, and log the error.
