"Good SEO work only gets better over time. It’s only search engine tricks that need to keep changing when the ranking algorithms change." - Jill Whalen

In today's competitive digital landscape, SEO optimization is more important than ever. A crucial factor in enhancing SEO is the method of rendering your application. Server-side rendering (SSR) has proven to be a game-changer in this regard.

SSR is a popular technique for rendering a client-side, single-page application (SPA) on the server and then sending a fully rendered page to the client. The client's JavaScript bundle can then take over and the SPA can operate as normal. SSR is advantageous for SEO as it allows search engine crawlers to index your website more efficiently.

Here's a brief example of how to implement SSR in a React application. 

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOMServer from 'react-dom/server';
import App from './App';

const app = express();

app.get('/*', (req, res) => {
  const appHtml = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<App />);
  res.send(appHtml);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

This simple server uses Express.js to serve our application. When a GET request is made, the server will respond with a string of HTML generated by `ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<App />)`. 

While SSR can improve your SEO, it’s not without its challenges. It can be complex to set up and can add more load to your server. Therefore, it's important to balance the potential SEO benefits of SSR against these considerations.

To further enhance your React applications, you might consider using computed state ([link](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/computed-state-in-react)) or implementing coding standards with Husky and TypeScript ([link](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged)).

"SEO is not something you do anymore. It’s what happens when you do everything else right." - Chad Pollitt

Remember, the ultimate goal of SEO is to improve the user experience and deliver high-quality, relevant content. SSR is just one part of this puzzle.
