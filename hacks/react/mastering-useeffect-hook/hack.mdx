"# Mastering useEffect Hook in React"

In React, the `useEffect` hook is a powerful tool that allows you to run side effects in function components. It's a crucial part of working with React, and mastering it can significantly improve your projects. This post will guide you through the basics of `useEffect` and how to use it effectively.

## Understanding Side Effects

In programming, a "side effect" is anything that affects something outside of the current function. In React, this could be data fetching, subscriptions, or manual DOM manipulation. These are all side effects that you can handle with `useEffect`.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
}, [count]);
```

Above, we are telling React to update the document title after React has updated the DOM. The second argument, `[count]`, is the list of dependencies for this effect.

## Managing Dependencies

The dependency array is a list of variables that, when changed, will trigger the effect to run. If no array is provided, the effect will run after every render. If an empty array is provided, the effect will only run once, similar to `componentDidMount` in class components.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // This runs ONCE after initial rendering
}, []);
```

## Clean-up Function

Sometimes, an effect might require a clean-up. For example, if you're setting up a subscription in an effect, you also need to clean it up to prevent memory leaks. You can do this by returning a function from your effect.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = props.source.subscribe();
  return () => {
    // Clean up the subscription
    subscription.unsubscribe();
  };
}, [props.source]);
```

Mastering `useEffect` can lead to more readable, maintainable code. It's an essential part of the React library, and understanding it thoroughly can make you a better developer.
