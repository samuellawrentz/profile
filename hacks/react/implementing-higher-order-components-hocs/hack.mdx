Higher-Order Components (HOCs) in React are a pattern derived from React's compositional nature. HOCs are a great way to reuse component logic, and their pattern involves a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

Here's a simple example of a HOC:

```javascript
function withExample(WrappedComponent) {
  return class extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  };
}
```

In the above code, `withExample` is a HOC. It's a function that takes a component `WrappedComponent` and returns a new component that renders the `WrappedComponent`.

To use this HOC, we can simply do:

```javascript
const EnhancedComponent = withExample(SomeComponent);
```

`EnhancedComponent` will have the same behavior as `SomeComponent`, but now it has the potential to be enhanced with additional props, state, or lifecycle methods.

Remember, HOCs are not part of the React API. They are a pattern that emerges from React's compositional nature.
