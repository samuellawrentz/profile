React `useEffect` hook can be a little tricky when dealing with asynchronous operations like fetching data from an API. Here's a simple way to handle it.

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com');
      const data = await response.json();
      setData(data);
    };
    fetchData();
  }, []);
  
  return (
      // Render your component
  );
}
```
In this example, we define an async function inside `useEffect` and immediately call it. This avoids directly adding `async` to `useEffect` which could lead to race conditions. Also, remember to include any dependencies in the dependency array (the second argument to `useEffect`), in this case it's an empty array because we only want to fetch data once on component mount.

By following this pattern, you can effectively manage asynchronous operations within `useEffect`. Happy coding!
