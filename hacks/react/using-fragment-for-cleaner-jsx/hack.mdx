React Fragments allow you to return multiple elements from a component's render method without creating an additional DOM element. They help in wrapping up multiple elements, leading to a cleaner and more readable JSX.

Here is an example of its usage:

```jsx
import React, { Fragment } from 'react';

function Component() {
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <h1>Title</h1>
      <p>Description</p>
    </Fragment>
  );
}
```

As you can see, instead of a `div` or any other wrapper, we are using `Fragment` which doesn't add any extra nodes to the DOM. This results in a more optimized and efficient code.

You can also use the short syntax for Fragments:

```jsx
function Component() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Title</h1>
      <p>Description</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

This reduces clutter in your JSX and aids in making your code cleaner and easier to understand. Happy coding!
