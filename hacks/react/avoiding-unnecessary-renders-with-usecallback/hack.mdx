React's `useCallback` hook can help to avoid unnecessary re-renders in your application, improving performance. It returns a memoized version of the callback function that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed.

```javascript
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(
  () => {
    doSomething(a, b);
  },
  [a, b],
);
```
In this snippet, `a` and `b` are the dependencies. The callback function will not be recreated unless either `a` or `b` changes.

Without `useCallback`, the function would be recreated every render, potentially causing unnecessary re-renders in child components that depend on the callback.

```javascript
function Component() {
  doSomething(a, b);

  return <ChildComponent callback={doSomething} />;
}
```
In this case, `doSomething` function is recreated every time `Component` re-renders, causing `ChildComponent` to re-render as well even if props have not changed.

By understanding and using `useCallback`, you can control when components re-render and optimize your React applications.
