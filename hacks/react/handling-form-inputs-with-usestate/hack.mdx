React's `useState` hook allows us to add state to our functional components. When it comes to forms, it's a powerful tool for capturing user input. Below is a basic example of how to use useState to handle form inputs.

First, we create a state variable and a function to update that state using `useState`.

```javascript
const [value, setValue] = useState("");
```
Next, we create an input field and assign its value to our state variable and its `onChange` event to our update function.

```javascript
<input type="text" value={value} onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)} />
```
In the above code, `e.target.value` is the current text in the input field. Each time the user types, the input's `onChange` event fires, updating the state with the current input text.

Remember to import the `useState` hook from `React` at the beginning of your file.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
```
And that's it! With just a few lines of code, you've created a reactive form input in React using `useState`.

Remember that each input field should have its own state variable. This way, you can capture and manage each input independently.
