Managing state in large React applications can be complex, but useContext hook simplifies it. The `useContext` hook is a built-in hook in React that allows you to share state and other data between components without passing props.

Here's a simple implementation:

```javascript
import React, { useContext, useState } from 'react';

const MyContext = React.createContext();

function ProviderComponent({ children }) {
  const [state, setState] = useState(0);
  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value={{ state, setState }}>
      {children}
    </MyContext.Provider>
  );
}

function ConsumerComponent() {
  const context = useContext(MyContext);
  return (
    <div>
      {context.state}
      <button onClick={() => context.setState(context.state + 1)}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the above code, `ProviderComponent` provides the state to its children. In `ConsumerComponent`, we use `useContext` to access the state and the `setState` function.

Remember, `useContext` doesn't replace Redux or other state management libraries but provides a simpler way for state sharing between components.
