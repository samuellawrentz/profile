React's `useRef` Hook allows us to access and interact with elements in the DOM directly. It retains its mutable `.current` property across multiple renders, making it a great tool for preserving values without re-rendering components.

Here's a simple example of how `useRef` can be used:

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function ExampleComponent() {
  const inputRef = useRef();

  const handleClick = () => {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={inputRef} type="text" />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Focus the input</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ExampleComponent;
```

In this example, `useRef` is used to create a reference (`inputRef`) to an input element. The `handleClick` function triggers a focus on this input when the button is clicked.

Remember, `useRef` does not notify you when its content changes. Mutating the `.current` property won't cause a re-render. If you need to run some code when React attaches or detaches a ref to a DOM node, you may want to use a callback ref instead.
