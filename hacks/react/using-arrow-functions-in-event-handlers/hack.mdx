Arrow functions in event handlers within React are a powerful tool to streamline your code and enhance functionality.

```javascript
class SampleComponent extends React.Component {
  handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Button clicked');
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        Click me
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

In the example above, `handleClick` is an arrow function which is bound to the context where it's defined, the `SampleComponent` instance. This ensures the correct `this` context even when the function is passed as a callback.

Unlike regular functions, arrow functions don't define their own `this` context. This makes them excellent for handling events in React, where you often need to access component properties within event handlers.

Remember, if you were to use a regular function for the event handler, you would need to bind `this` in the constructor, adding unnecessary lines of code.

```javascript
class SampleComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }

  handleClick() {
    console.log('Button clicked');
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        Click me
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

Mastering the use of arrow functions in event handlers is a crucial step towards becoming a proficient React developer.
