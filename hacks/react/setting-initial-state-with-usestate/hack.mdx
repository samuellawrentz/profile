When using React, it’s often necessary to set an initial state for your components. This can be achieved using the `useState` hook.

Here's how you can set the initial state:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [state, setState] = useState('Initial State');

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{state}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In the above example, `useState` hook is called with the initial state 'Initial State'. It returns a pair — the current state value (`state` in our case) and a function that lets you update it (`setState`).

The `useState` hook is a built-in function in React that lets you add and manipulate state in functional components. This was not possible in earlier versions of React without converting the functional component into a class component.
