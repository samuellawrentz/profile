React's Context API provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. 

First, create a context.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);
```

Next, provide the context to the components that need it.

```javascript
<MyContext.Provider value={/* some value */}>
```

Finally, consume it in your components.

```javascript
class MyClassComponent extends React.Component {
  static contextType = MyContext;
  render() {
    return <div>{this.context}</div>; // value from MyContext.Provider
  }
}
```

Or in functional components, use the `useContext` Hook.

```javascript
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
const value = useContext(MyContext);
```

Remember, Context API is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, like the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language.
