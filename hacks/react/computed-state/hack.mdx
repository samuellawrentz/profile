In React, computed state is often used to derive data from the main state. It's important to remember one constraint - direct manipulation of state is forbidden in React.

Suppose, we have an existing state:

```javascript
this.state = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe'
};
```

To compute a value based on this state, you would create a function that will be executed within the render method:

```javascript
fullName() {
  return `${this.state.firstName} ${this.state.lastName}`;
}
```

Then call this function in your render method:

```javascript
render() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{this.fullName()}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now, the full name is dynamically calculated and will update as soon as either its first or last name changes.

The use of computed state can significantly decrease complexity in your code by avoiding storing redundant data and ensuring that your data is always consistent. Remember that improperly handling computed state may result in inconsistency and subtle bugs in your application.
