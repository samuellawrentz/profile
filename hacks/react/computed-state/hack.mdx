In React, computed state is often used to derive data from the main state. It's important to remember one constraint - direct manipulation of state is forbidden in React. You can learn more about this concept in this [blog post on computed state in React](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/computed-state-in-react).

Suppose, we have an existing state:

```javascript
this.state = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe'
};
```

To compute a value based on this state, you would create a function that will be executed within the render method. You can refer to this [blog post on coding standards with TypeScript](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged) to understand better coding practices.

```javascript
fullName() {
  return `${this.state.firstName} ${this.state.lastName}`;
}
```

Then call this function in your render method:

```javascript
render() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{this.fullName()}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now, the full name is dynamically calculated and will update as soon as either its first or last name changes. This [article on conditional rendering with the AND operator](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/conditional-rendering-with-and-operator) can give further insights on dynamic rendering in React.

The use of computed state can significantly decrease complexity in your code by avoiding storing redundant data and ensuring that your data is always consistent. Remember that improperly handling computed state may result in inconsistency and subtle bugs in your application. You can refer to this [blog post on using useEffect for lifecycle events](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/use-effect-for-lifecycle-events) to understand how to handle state changes efficiently.
