# Introduction

In the world of React, managing application state can get complex as your app grows. Here's where MobX comes in. MobX simplifies state management, making your React application more maintainable and efficient.

# Installing and Setting Up MobX

First, install MobX and MobX React binding in your project:

```bash
npm install mobx mobx-react
```

# Creating an Observable State

In MobX, any data source that can change is an observable. Let's create a simple store with an observable state:

```javascript
import { observable } from 'mobx';

class TodoStore {
  @observable todos = [];
}
```

# Updating and Using Observable State

To change the state, you simply assign a new value to it. And to use it, you can use the `observer` function from `mobx-react`:

```javascript
import { observer } from 'mobx-react';

@observer
class TodoList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {this.props.store.todos.map(todo => <div>{todo}</div>)}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

# Computing Derived Values

MobX has a `computed` function that you can use to derive values from your state, similar to how you'd use selectors. Here's how you can use it:

```javascript
import { observable, computed } from 'mobx';

class TodoStore {
  @observable todos = [];
  @computed get completedTodosCount() {
    return this.todos.filter(todo => todo.completed === true).length;
  }
}
```

# Actions

Actions in MobX are methods that modify state. They make it easier to manage complex updates:

```javascript
import { observable, action } from 'mobx';

class TodoStore {
  @observable todos = [];
  @action addTodo(todo) {
    this.todos.push(todo);
  }
}
```

Remember, MobX is just a tool. It's up to you, the developer, to use it wisely. As the saying goes,
