In React, when updating state based on the previous state, it's recommended to use the `setState` function with a callback.

The reason is that `setState` is asynchronous, which can lead to unexpected results when you update the state multiple times in a row. Using a callback ensures that the updates are executed in the correct order.

Here's an example:

```javascript
this.setState(prevState => ({
  counter: prevState.counter + 1,
}));
```

In this case, `prevState` is the state at the time the update is applied, ensuring a reliable state update.

Remember, return a new object to avoid mutating the original state. Avoid this common pitfall to ensure your React apps stay bug-free and efficient.

Happy coding!

```javascript
this.setState(prevState => {
  prevState.counter++; // Don't do this!
});
```

These are some simple yet powerful techniques to master React state management.
