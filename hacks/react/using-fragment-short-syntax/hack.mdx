In React, a common pattern is to return a list of children. However, adding a wrapper div to your result can mess up your styling or you might not want an extra node in the DOM. This is where React Fragments come in handy. 

React Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM. And the short syntax `<>` is a sweet syntactic sugar for `<React.Fragment>`. Here's how to use it:

```jsx
function ExampleComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <ChildA />
      <ChildB />
      <ChildC />
    </>
  );
}
```
In the code snippet above, `ExampleComponent` is returning multiple children, `ChildA`, `ChildB`, and `ChildC`, without a wrapper div, thanks to the `<>` short syntax.

Remember, while the short syntax is handy, it does not support keys or attributes. Use `<React.Fragment>` when you need them.
