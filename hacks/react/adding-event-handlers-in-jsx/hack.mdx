To add event handlers in JSX, we utilize camelCase syntax rather than lowercase. Let's consider a button click event. In plain JavaScript, it would look like this:

```javascript
<button onclick="activateFunction()">Click Me!</button>
```

In React's JSX, we modify it to:

```jsx
<button onClick={activateFunction}>Click Me!</button>
```

Here `activateFunction` is a function defined in your component. Remember, in JSX, you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

Event handlers in React are attached directly to components and, when using class components, typically trigger methods. This is slightly different from assigning events to DOM in HTML.

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  activateFunction() {
    // your code here
  }

  render() {
    return <button onClick={this.activateFunction}>Click Me!</button>
  }
}
```

Note: Make sure to bind your methods in class components to access `this`.

This guide should help you get started with event handlers in JSX!
