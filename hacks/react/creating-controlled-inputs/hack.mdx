Creating controlled inputs in React is crucial for managing form data. A controlled input accepts its current value as a prop and callback to change that value.

Here is a simple example of a controlled input component in React:

```jsx
class ControlledInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {value: ''};

    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  }

  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({value: event.target.value});
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <input type="text" value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
    );
  }
}
```

In this component, the value of the input is always driven by the React state. When you type in the input field, it triggers `handleChange` which updates the state, causing a re-render with the new value.

This setup gives you more control over your input elements and allows for more complex behaviors. It's a fundamental concept that will enhance your React development skills. 

Remember, the key is to keep your inputs controlled by maintaining the component's state as the single source of truth.
