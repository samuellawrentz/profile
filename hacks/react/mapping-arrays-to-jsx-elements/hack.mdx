In React, a common requirement is to render a list of items. This can be achieved by mapping arrays to JSX elements.

Consider an array of strings:

```javascript
const fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'];
```

To render these as a list, we use the JavaScript `map` function. Each item in the array becomes a JSX element:

```javascript
{fruits.map((fruit) => 
  <li key={fruit}>{fruit}</li>
)}
```

Here, each `fruit` in the `fruits` array is passed to an arrow function, which returns a JSX `<li>` element. The `key` prop is essential when creating lists in React because it helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

The output will be:

```html
<li>Apple</li>
<li>Banana</li>
<li>Cherry</li>
```

This technique allows you to dynamically render lists or grids in your React applications.
