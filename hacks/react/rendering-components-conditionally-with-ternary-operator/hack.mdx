Conditional rendering in React allows us to display different components or results based on certain conditions. A handy way to achieve this is by using the ternary operator. 

The ternary operator is a one-line shortcut for the `if-else` statement. It checks a condition and returns a value based on whether the condition is `true` or `false`.

Here is a simple example:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const isUserLoggedIn = true;
  return (
    <div>
      {isUserLoggedIn ? <LogoutButton /> : <LoginButton />}
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, if `isUserLoggedIn` is `true`, `<LogoutButton />` is rendered, otherwise `<LoginButton />` is rendered. This allows us to conditionally render components in a clean and concise way.

Remember that the condition should always return a boolean (`true` or `false`) for the ternary operator to work properly. 

Mastering conditional rendering techniques such as these will allow you to create more dynamic and interactive user interfaces in React.

Happy coding!
