## Customizing Neovim

Neovim’s true power lies in its customization. You can tailor it to suit your coding style and preferences. Here’s how you can get started with basic customization:

### Setting Up Your Configuration File

You can create a `init.vim` file in your configuration directory:

```sh
mkdir ~/.config/nvim
touch ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
```

### Adding Basic Settings

Here's a simple configuration to enhance your experience:

```vim
set number              " Show line numbers
syntax on               " Enable syntax highlighting
set tabstop=4           " Set tab width to 4 spaces
set shiftwidth=4        " Set indentation width to 4 spaces
set expandtab           " Convert tabs to spaces
```

## Leveraging Plugins

Neovim supports a vast array of plugins to boost productivity. Using a plugin manager like [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) simplifies the process.

### Installing vim-plug

First, install vim-plug:

```sh
curl -fLo ~/.local/share/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

### Adding Plugins to Your Configuration

Add the following to your `init.vim`:

```vim
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')

Plug 'preservim/nerdtree'         " File system explorer
Plug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'do': { -> fzf#install() } }
Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim', {'branch': 'release'}  " Intellisense engine

call plug#end()
```

Then, install the plugins by running:

```vim
:PlugInstall
```

## Enhancing Productivity

Neovim’s efficiency can be further enhanced with key mappings and commands.

### Key Mappings

Custom key mappings can save you time:

```vim
nnoremap <C-n> :NERDTreeToggle<CR>  " Toggle NERDTree with Ctrl+n
inoremap jk <Esc>                   " Exit insert mode quickly by pressing 'jk'
```
