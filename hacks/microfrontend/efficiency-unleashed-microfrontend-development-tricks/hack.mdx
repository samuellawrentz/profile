MicroFrontend architecture is a design approach where a large application is divided into smaller, more manageable pieces. Itâ€™s a game-changer for teams working on large-scale projects. Here are a few tricks to enhance your development process:

1. **Define clear boundaries**: MicroFrontend is all about separation of concerns. Define clear boundaries for each component to avoid dependencies. 

```javascript
// Example in React
function Component() {
  return (
    <div>
      // Code specific to this component
    </div>
  );
}
```

2. **Use shared libraries**: Shared libraries can be used across different components to avoid code duplication.

```javascript
import { SharedComponent } from 'shared-library';
```

3. **Communicate via events**: Components communicate with each other via events. This approach ensures loose coupling and high cohesion.

```javascript
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('EventName', { detail: { data } }));
```

Remember, the end goal is to create a maintainable codebase, where each piece functions independently, yet seamlessly integrates with the whole. Happy coding!
