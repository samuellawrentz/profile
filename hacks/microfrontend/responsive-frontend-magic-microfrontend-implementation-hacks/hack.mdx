MicroFrontends, an approach to developing web applications as a composition of features owned by different teams, has emerged as a game-changer in web development. Here are some hacks to assist your implementation:

1. **Use Framework Agnostic Components:** To ensure your micro apps can operate with any framework, it's advisable to use custom elements.
```javascript
    class MyElement extends HTMLElement {
        // Your element's functionality here
    }
    customElements.define('my-element', MyElement);
```

2. **State Management:** For managing states across micro apps, use a library like Redux. Share only necessary global state.
```javascript
    const store = createStore(reducer);
```

3. **Consistent Styling:** Implement a shared style guide across teams to maintain a consistent user interface.

4. **Test Independently:** Each micro app should be independently testable and deployable.

5. **Performance Check:** Use Lighthouse or similar tools to measure the performance of your micro frontends.

Remember, the goal is to create a cohesive user experience while breaking up the frontend into manageable, independent parts. Happy Coding!
