MicroFrontends allow developers to break up monolithic UIs into smaller, manageable components. This approach can be a game-changer, but it does come with its challenges, especially when it comes to integration. Here are some secrets to ensure seamless UI harmony.

**1. Consistent Design System:** Use a design system across all micro apps to ensure visual consistency. 

```javascript
// React code for a button component
import { Button } from 'design-system';

<Button variant="primary">Click me!</Button>
```

**2. Shared Dependency Versioning:** Keep dependency versions in sync across all micro apps to prevent unexpected behaviors.

```json
// package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^16.13.1"
  }
}
```

**3. Use of Custom Events:** Leverage the CustomEvent API for communication between micro apps.

```javascript
// dispatch a custom event
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('myEvent', { detail: 'Hello from Micro app A' }));

// listen to the custom event
window.addEventListener('myEvent', (event) => console.log(event.detail));
```

Remember, the key to MicroFrontend integration is consistency and clear communication between components. Happy coding!
