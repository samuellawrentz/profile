The Micro Frontend architecture is a design approach where a front-end app is decomposed into individual, semi-independent "micro-apps" working loosely together. This approach can improve the productivity of your team but can also introduce new challenges related to cross-team communication.

## Tip 1: Use Custom Events

Custom events can be used to communicate between micro frontends. 

```javascript
// Microfrontend 1
document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('myEvent', { detail: 'data from microfrontend 1' }));

// Microfrontend 2
document.addEventListener('myEvent', (e) => {
  console.log(e.detail);
});
```

## Tip 2: Shared State

Another approach is to use shared state, which can be implemented with libraries such as Redux or MobX.

```javascript
// Shared store
import { createStore } from 'redux';

const store = createStore(myReducer);

// Microfrontend 1
store.dispatch({ type: 'ACTION_TYPE', payload: 'data from microfrontend 1' });

// Microfrontend 2
store.subscribe(() => {
  console.log(store.getState());
});
```

Remember, cross-team collaboration with Micro Frontends is all about setting up efficient communication channels. Happy coding!
