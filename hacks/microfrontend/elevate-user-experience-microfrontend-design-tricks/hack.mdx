MicroFrontend architecture allows you to split your application into smaller, more manageable parts. This can significantly improve the user experience (UX) of your web application. Here are a couple of tricks:

1. **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading to boost your application's performance. It ensures that only necessary components are loaded, reducing the initial load time.

```javascript
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <LazyComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

2. **Component Sharing**: Share common components across different microfrontends using a shared library. This promotes consistency across your application.

```javascript
// Shared Component stored in a library
export const SharedButton = () => <button>Shared Button</button>;

// Importing in different microfrontends
import { SharedButton } from 'shared-library';
```

Use these tricks to create a more efficient and user-friendly web application with MicroFrontend and React.
