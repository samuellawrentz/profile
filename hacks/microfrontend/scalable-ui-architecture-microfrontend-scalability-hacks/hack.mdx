Micro Frontend architecture helps in developing highly scalable and maintainable applications. Here are some hacks.

**1. Component Sharing:** Use a design system to share components across teams. This improves consistency and reduces code duplication.

```javascript
// React component
export const Button = ({ children, onClick }) => (
  <button onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>
);
```

**2. Lazy Loading:** Load components only when needed, reducing the initial load time.

```javascript
// React.lazy for code-splitting
const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));
```

**3. State Management:** Use a global state management solution like Redux to share state across micro frontends.

```javascript
// Redux store
import { createStore } from 'redux';
const store = createStore(reducer);
```

**4. Continuous Deployment:** Automate the deployment process. This ensures that each team can deploy their changes independently.

```bash
# CI/CD command
git push origin main && npm run deploy
```

Remember, the key to scalability is maintaining small, autonomous teams and codebases. Happy coding!
