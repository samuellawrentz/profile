MicroFrontends is a design approach that divides a monolithic frontend app into smaller, more manageable pieces. Here are some key hacks to maximize its use:

**1. Consistent Design System:** Ensure a consistent look and feel across your micro apps. Consider using a shared design system or library.

```javascript
// Use shared components from a design system
import { Button } from 'shared-design-system';
```

**2. Decoupled Deployment:** Deploy your micro apps independently. It speeds up the development process and reduces the risk of breaking changes.

```bash
# Example of deploying a micro app
npm run deploy:micro-app
```

**3. Communication:** Establish effective communication between your micro apps. Use CustomEvents, Redux or even Context API for state management, depending on the complexity.

```javascript
// Using CustomEvents for communication
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('eventName', { detail: 'data' }));
```

**4. Use React:** React's component-based architecture fits well with the MicroFrontends approach.

```javascript
// A simple React component
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => <div>Hello, MicroFrontend!</div>;

export default MyComponent;
```

Remember, the idea is to break down the complexities by dividing the application into smaller parts. Happy coding!
