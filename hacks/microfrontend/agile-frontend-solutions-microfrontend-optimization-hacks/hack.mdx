MicroFrontend frameworks offer a great platform for building scalable and maintainable web applications. Here are a few optimization hacks.

**1. Lazy Loading**: Lazy load components to speed up initial load times. 

```javascript
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';
const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./Component'));

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <LazyComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

**2. Code Splitting**: Use webpack's SplitChunksPlugin to split your code into smaller chunks. 

```javascript
module.exports = {
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      chunks: 'all',
    },
  },
};
```

**3. Minimize HTTP Requests**: Bundle assets together to reduce HTTP requests. 

**4. Use Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: SSR can improve the SEO and initial load time of your application. 

Remember, a well-optimized MicroFrontend application will significantly improve the user experience. Happy coding!
