As a web developer, you would want your code to be efficient, maintainable, and scalable. MicroFrontend, coupled with React, can make this happen with a few integration hacks.

1. **Use Module Federation**: This is a Webpack 5 feature that allows you to load JavaScript modules at runtime. This helps you avoid versioning conflicts and allows for smooth integration of micro frontends.

```javascript
new ModuleFederationPlugin({
  name: 'app1',
  filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
  exposes: {
    './Button': './src/Button',
  },
  shared: ['react', 'react-dom'],
}),
```

2. **Utilize Custom Events**: Use the `dispatchEvent` method to send custom events between micro frontends. This helps in maintaining state consistency across different parts of your app.

```javascript
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('myEvent', {detail: {data: 'test'}}));
```

3. **Negotiate Styles**: Maintain a common style guide or use CSS-in-JS libraries, like Styled Components, to manage styles across different micro frontends. This ensures UI consistency.

```javascript
import styled from 'styled-components';

const Button = styled.button`
  background: palevioletred;
  color: white;
`;
```

Remember, the key to successful micro frontend integration is clear communication and standardized practices across all teams involved.
