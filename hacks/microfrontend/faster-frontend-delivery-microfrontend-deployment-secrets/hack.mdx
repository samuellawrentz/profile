MicroFrontend architecture divides a monolithic app into smaller, manageable parts, each with its own codebase. This makes frontend delivery faster and more efficient. Here are some secrets:

**1. Decouple from the main application:** 

Easily manage and deploy MicroFrontends independently from the main app. 

```javascript
// Your main app
const mainApp = express();

// Your micro frontend
const microFrontend = express();
```

**2. Use a Version Control System (VCS):**

A VCS like Git helps manage different versions of your app and coordinate work between developers.

```bash
# initialize a new git repo
git init
```

**3. Leverage CI/CD pipelines:**

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines automate your deployment process, ensuring faster delivery.

```yaml
# simple CI/CD pipeline
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Build app
      run: npm run build
```

**4. Component Sharing:**

Using a design system or component library ensures consistency and speeds up development.

```javascript
// React component
export default function Button(props) {
  // render button
}
```

MicroFrontend architecture accelerates frontend delivery and increases flexibility. Embrace it and enjoy the benefits!
