## The Foundations of Ancient Philosophy

Ancient philosophy, particularly from Greek thinkers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, has profoundly influenced modern thinking. Their ideas laid the groundwork for contemporary thought in various fields, including ethics, politics, and science. 

### Socratic Method and Critical Thinking

Socrates introduced the **Socratic Method**, a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue. This technique is still used today in law schools and intellectual discussions to stimulate critical thinking and illuminate ideas. The method involves asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and draw out underlying presuppositions.

```python
# An example of a Socratic questioning model in Python
def socratic_method(question):
    answers = {
        "What is justice?": "Justice is fairness.",
        "What is truth?": "Truth is coherence with reality."
    }
    return answers.get(question, "Let's delve deeper into that question.")
    
print(socratic_method("What is justice?"))
```

### Platonic Ideals and Modern Ethics

Plato's theory of **Forms** or **Ideals** suggests that the material world is a shadow of a higher reality. This concept has influenced modern metaphysics and ethics, proposing that there are absolute truths and ideals we should strive for. Plato's works continue to be a cornerstone in discussions about morality and the nature of reality.

> "The object of knowledge is what exists and its function to know about reality." - Plato

### Aristotelian Logic and Scientific Method

Aristotle's work in logic and the **scientific method** has been foundational for modern science and philosophy. His **syllogistic logic** forms the basis of deductive reasoning, a critical aspect of scientific inquiry and rational argumentation.

```javascript
// Example of Aristotelian logic in JavaScript
function syllogism(premise1, premise2) {
    if (premise1 === "All humans are mortal" && premise2 === "Socrates is a human") {
        return "Socrates is mortal";
    }
    return "Invalid syllogism";
}

console.log(syllogism("All humans are mortal", "Socrates is a human"));
```

### Stoicism and Modern Psychology

The Stoics, like Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, emphasized personal ethics informed by a system of logic and natural law. Stoicism's principles of resilience and emotional control have found a place in modern psychology, particularly in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).

> "The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts." - Marcus Aurelius
