"Agility is not just about speed. It's about responsiveness, flexibility, and delivering value."  - Anonymous

Modern software development is all about being responsive and adaptable. The Agile Software Development philosophy, with its iterative approach and emphasis on collaboration, is an embodiment of this principle. 

In essence, Agile development is about prioritizing individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change. It's a shift from the traditional waterfall model, where every phase of a project is planned upfront. 

```python
# Agile approach
def develop_software():
    while not project_complete:
        gather_requirements()
        design()
        code()
        test()
        deploy()
        get_feedback()
        if feedback_positive:
            project_complete = True
```

This [blog post](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged) discusses how to maintain coding standards, which is crucial in Agile development due to its emphasis on teamwork and collaboration. 

Agile also introduces practices like Test-Driven Development (TDD), Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD), and Pair Programming. These practices ensure the software is always in a releasable state and fosters a culture of shared responsibility. 

```javascript
// Test-Driven Development in JS
describe('add', function() {
    it('adds two numbers', function() {
        expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3);
    });
});
```

Embracing agility requires a shift in mindset, not just in development practices. It's about being open to change and continuously learning and improving. As the Agile Manifesto puts it, *"We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it."*

In the end, it's all about delivering value to the customer in the most effective way. This [blog](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/computed-state-in-react) provides an excellent example of how to deliver value using computed state in React.

"Being adaptable is the key principle of agility; adaptability is all about being prepared for change and not reacting to it after it has occurred." - Unknown
