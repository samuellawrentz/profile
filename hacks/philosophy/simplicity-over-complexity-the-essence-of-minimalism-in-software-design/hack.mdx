_"The art of simplicity is a puzzle of complexity."_ - Douglas Horton

In the realm of software engineering, the philosophy of **Simplicity Over Complexity** plays a vital role. This principle, an essential part of minimalistic software design, advocates for maintaining the simplicity of code, reducing cognitive load for developers, and enhancing maintainability.

Consider an example:

```javascript
// Complex code
function calculateSalary(employee) {
    if(employee.type === 'fulltime') {
        return employee.hoursWorked * employee.hourlyRate;
    } else if(employee.type === 'parttime') {
        return employee.hoursWorked * employee.hourlyRate * 0.5;
    }
}

// Simplified code
function calculateSalary(employee) {
    let rate = employee.type === 'fulltime' ? 1 : 0.5;
    return employee.hoursWorked * employee.hourlyRate * rate;
}
```

The simplified code is easier to understand, maintain, and less prone to errors. This embodies the concept of simplicity over complexity. 

Minimalism in software design is not just about writing less code. It's also about [creating simpler architecture](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/vim-experience-nvim-dev-experience/), [increasing build speeds](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/gatsby-incremental-faster-builds-github-actions/), and [using computed state in React](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/computed-state-in-react), among others. 

Following [coding standards](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged) and [utilizing bookmarklets](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/bookmarklets/) can help maintain simplicity. Monitoring [website pagespeed](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/monitor-website-pagespeed-with-googlesheets/) and using [Jira git commit workflow](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/jira-git-commit-workflow-vscode-extension/) can also contribute to a minimalist approach.

_"Simplicity is the soul of efficiency."_ - Austin Freeman

In conclusion, simplicity over complexity is a philosophy that encourages minimalism in software design, making software systems more maintainable, efficient, and reliable. 

Embrace simplicity. Master Minimalism. Happy Coding!
