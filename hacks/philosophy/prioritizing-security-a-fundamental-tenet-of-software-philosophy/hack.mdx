"Security is not an add-on, but a fundamental part of software. It's not a feature; it's a necessity." - Bruce Schneier

In the modern era of software development, prioritizing security is not just an option; it's a necessity. It is one of the key tenets of software philosophy, underlining the fact that the safety of user data and system integrity cannot be compromised at any cost.

## Prioritizing Security in Your Code

When it comes to implementing security in your code, it is not just about using security tools or libraries but about making it an integral part of your development process. Here's a basic example of how you can incorporate security checks in your code:

```javascript
function authenticateUser(username, password) {
  if (!username || !password) {
    throw new Error('Username or password missing');
  }

  // Add more security checks here...
}
```

This code snippet ensures that both username and password are provided before proceeding further, acting as a basic yet crucial security check.

## Security as a Philosophy

Security is not a one-time task, but a continuous process. It should be ingrained in every phase of software development - from planning and designing to coding, testing, and maintenance.

Remember, security is not an afterthought. It is a fundamental tenet of software philosophy that must be prioritized right from the start. As [Samuel Lawrentz](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged) rightly mentions in his post, adhering to coding standards is a good starting point in this journey.

## Conclusion

Embracing security as a part of your software philosophy is not just about preventing potential threats or vulnerabilities. It's about building trust with your users, ensuring data integrity, and delivering a secure user experience.

"Security is always excessive until it's not enough." - Robbie Sinclair
