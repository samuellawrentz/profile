In the realm of software development, one philosophy stands above the rest: Putting Users First. This approach, often referred to as User-Centric Software Development, emphasizes the importance of making user needs the focal point of software design and implementation.

```javascript
function userNeeds() {
  return "User needs are paramount for software development";
}
```
In essence, it's about ensuring the software meets the needs, expectations, and preferences of the end-user. This involves a deep understanding of who your users are, what they need, and how they interact with your software.

This philosophy can be integrated into different stages of software development. From the initial design process, through coding standards, to the final testing stage. 

[Samuel Lawrentz](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged) provides an excellent guide on how to maintain coding standards in TypeScript, which is a vital part of user-centric software development.

```typescript
const codingStandard = () => {
  return "Coding standards are crucial in user-centric software development";
}
```

Famed computer scientist Donald Knuth once said, "The User is always right." This mantra encapsulates the spirit of User-Centric Software Development. By putting users at the heart of your software, you create a product that is not only functional but also user-friendly, reliable, and efficient.

The user-centric approach also requires developers to keep improving and adapting their software based on user feedback and needs. A guide to using [computed state in React](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/computed-state-in-react) can be handy in this respect, as it allows developers to make their software more responsive and user-friendly.

```react
const UserFeedback = ({feedback}) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {feedback.map((item) => (
        <p>{item}</p>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

In conclusion, User-Centric Software Development is a philosophy that prioritizes the needs and expectations of users. It is a powerful approach that can significantly improve the quality and functionality of your software.

As the great Steve Jobs once said, "You've got to start with the customer experience and work back toward the technology - not the other way around." This encapsulates the essence of User-Centric Software Development, making it an essential philosophy for all software developers to grasp and apply.
