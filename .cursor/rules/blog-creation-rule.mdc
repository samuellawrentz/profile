# Blog Creation Rule - Samuel's Writing Style

## Content Structure & Length
- Target length: 500-800 words (flexible based on topic complexity)
- Use markdown format with proper front matter
- Reference front matter structure from [post.mdx](mdc:blog/gatsby-og-image/post.mdx)
- Use [default.png](mdc:blog/default.png) as default heroImage unless topic-specific image is provided

## Writing Voice & Tone
- **Conversational and relatable**: Write like you're talking to a friend over coffee
- **Self-deprecating humor**: Share personal struggles and "fails" in a humorous way
- **Kevin Hart-style energy**: Quick, energetic, and enthusiastic but not over-the-top
- **Tech-savvy but accessible**: Explain complex concepts in simple terms
- **Storytelling approach**: Use narrative structure with clear beginning, middle, and end

## Content Patterns
### Opening Style
- Start with a relatable scenario or personal anecdote
- Use phrases like "Hey there, folks!" or "Picture this:"
- Set up the problem/challenge before diving into solutions
- Include warnings for technical content when appropriate

### Body Structure
- **Use analogies and metaphors**: Compare tech concepts to everyday things
- **Include personal timeline/journey**: Show the process, not just the result
- **Break down complex topics**: Use subheadings and bullet points
- **Share search history/struggles**: Be transparent about the learning process
- **Include practical examples**: Always provide working code snippets

### Technical Content
- Provide complete, runnable code examples
- Include installation commands and setup instructions
- Explain the "why" behind technical decisions
- Use proper syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Don't over-comment code - only explain complex logic

## Humor & Personality
- **Coffee references**: Frequent mentions of coffee consumption during coding
- **Time-based narratives**: Hour-by-hour breakdowns of problem-solving sessions
- **Self-aware commentary**: Acknowledge when things go wrong or take longer than expected
- **Pop culture references**: Occasional references to movies, games, or internet culture
- **Celebration of small wins**: Express genuine excitement about solving problems

## Linking Strategy
- **Extensive internal linking**: Reference 4-6 other blog posts per article
- **Natural link integration**: Weave links into the narrative flow
- **External resource links**: Include official documentation and helpful tools
- **Cross-promotion**: Link to related projects and tools you've built

## Technical Standards
- Always include working code examples
- Provide package installation commands
- Mention browser compatibility when relevant
- Include performance considerations
- Reference official documentation

## Audience Considerations
- Target: Interns to senior developers
- Assume basic programming knowledge but explain advanced concepts
- Include both beginner-friendly explanations and advanced tips
- Make content valuable for different skill levels

## Content Placement
- Save all blog files in the `blog/` folder
- Create topic-specific subdirectories when needed
- Include relevant images in the same directory as the post

## Style Guidelines
- Use bold text for emphasis on key points
- Include code snippets with proper language tags
- Don't use too much emojis
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity
- Include relevant emojis sparingly (mainly for celebration/conclusion)
- End with encouraging or motivational statements
