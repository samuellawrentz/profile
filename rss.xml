It looks kinda cool when people are able to see your work around the globe.
So the journey is as follows, Imagine you are in the year 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; was the josh, wherever I turn I was seeing wordpress blogs. I&amp;#x27;m not the one against wordpress, but somehow I wanted to have complete control over my website, not just the content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I started a wordpress blog back when I was in college in 2017 - &lt;a href=&quot;samuellawrentzz.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Towards Infinity&lt;/a&gt;. I was a philosopher back then. I used to write about life and all the other things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Things were going good, then I got a job, moved into web development team, got to know about a lot of people. I posted my first tech article on a website called &lt;a href=&quot;https://efficientuser.com&quot;&gt;Efficient User&lt;/a&gt; - a blog maintained by my senior collegue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I instantly felt awesome to write about tech and the things I know, so after few days, I began thinking about my own domain and own blog and stuff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;But they were just thoughts, they were never made into actions. Then suddenly I got the flame one day and purchased this domain - samuellawrentz.com and purchased a hosting plan at &lt;a href=&quot;https://hostlinger.com&quot;&gt;Hostlinger&lt;/a&gt; (which I regret till now)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They had this wordpress hosting - 4 year plan, which I brought with full energy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I started my tech blog officially on the year 2020. It was a basic Wordpress site loaded with big ass plugins. I felt like thanos, having the powers of the stone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I took a decision to write regularly, but hey, dedication sucks. I went dark for the next two years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now again, I&amp;#x27;ve got the flame, this time much stronger. I created this blog from scratch, taking reference and inspiration from various other blogs. I created my portfolio website.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;PageSpeed&lt;/strong&gt; is almost 100&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The page size is maximum &lt;strong&gt;22kb&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The design is sleek&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have full control over what gets shown&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#x27;s &lt;strong&gt;React&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;GatsbyJS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel great&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now I want to make this blog a place where developers can learn new things and this also serves as a portfolio for my profile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wish me luck over the coming years - wanna see some traffic here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any suggestions or improvements or tips and tricks, please DM me or &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=samuellawrentz&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot; class=&quot;twitter-mention-button&quot; data-show-count=&quot;false&quot;&gt;Tweet to @samuellawrentz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charSet=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Growing your Online Presence - 101]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this modern world, the world where everything is digital from currency to emotions, an online…]]></description><link>https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/how-to-grow-your-online-presence</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/how-to-grow-your-online-presence</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this modern world, the world where everything is digital from currency to emotions, an online presence is very important. Previously, just owning a website/blog meant that you have a strong online presence, but now, in this age of internet, there is just more to that. Just google your name or the name of your product/company. How much relevant results pop up? How many social media profiles do you maintain? All these factors your online presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Online Presence?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the internet, how far has your name reached? How many users can recognize your brand? For example consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://amazon.com&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://google.com&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, they are on the zenith of digital marketing. Almost everyone who uses the internet knows these names. That’s called Online Presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Things that increase your Online Presence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blogging&lt;/strong&gt; – This helps in generating content related to your product or niche. As more people read and share your content, your fingerprint on the internet grows.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Media&lt;/strong&gt; – You know there are a lot of social media platforms out there. Make sure that you are active on at least 4 of them. I would recommend – Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search Engine Optimisation&lt;/strong&gt; – Also known as SEO. This plays a key role in bringing organic traffic to your site. Optimize your site/blog so that Google can understand the content and bring people to you. This time you don’t spread the word, the search engines spread.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytics&lt;/strong&gt; – This doesn’t directly impact your online presence but keeping tabs of who your visitors are and what they want can greatly benefit you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ads&lt;/strong&gt; – More than half of the internet survives through Advertisements. Yes, they can cost you but they are worth the money.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content is the king&lt;/strong&gt; – People are attracted to what gives value to them. They don’t come to you because you sell a product. They come to you because they want it. So your content/product should be the key to all of these. Give people what they want, and your name will spread throughout.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Okay, but How?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, you have only 2 hands, 2 eyes, and 1 brain and 24 hours. How can you do all these in parallel? That’s where automation comes into play. Now businesses have understood the importance of online presence and have come up with automation tools for almost every task that you can even think of. Tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com&quot;&gt;Zapier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ifttt.com/&quot;&gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://buffer.com&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt;, etc they take these burdens from you so that you can focus on the content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep posting more content on your blog and share them across social media platforms. Keep everything in sync so that you don’t have to post on each platform separately. Also, consistency is the key, people as well as google crawlers like consistency. So whatever you do, keep it consistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;To conclude&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online presence is not something that can be brought from a shop. It takes time to harvest. You need to be patient. There are many shortcuts, but most of them won’t work properly. They seem to look like it is working, but it won’t. Just be true and patient and consistent, you will reap the fruits later.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to post to Instagram using an API?]]></title><description><![CDATA[I like to automate things very much, so I was looking for a way to automate my Instagram account.

I searched and looked for many ways and all of them seemed to be impossible. It is because Instagram doesn’t provide an API that can post images for you. After quite a few days of research, I came across a technique that would help us post to Instagram using an API – &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dilame/instagram-private-api&quot;&gt;The Instagram-Private-API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Instagram Private API&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Instagram Private API is kind of like a back door to Instagram where you can manipulate and control Instagram as to how you would do in the real mobile application. You can like, comment, share, publish stories, or even send a DM using this API. This API is not very famous because your account could be at risk if you use this API.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here at &lt;a href=&quot;https://offshorewritings.com&quot;&gt;offshorewritings.com&lt;/a&gt;, most of our social media interactions are automated. Thanks to Google’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer&quot;&gt;Puppeteer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dashboard.heroku.com/&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com/&quot;&gt;Zapier&lt;/a&gt;. We have reduced the effort to publish to post our quotes and articles across various platforms. I’ve shared the code which can be used to login to Instagram and upload a photo for you through the API. There are also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dilame/instagram-private-api/tree/master/examples&quot;&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; where you can post an image directly from a web URL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Code to post via API&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use this code directly to post to Instagram from the API, just a couple of lines. Before using it make sure that you have the packages installed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;deckgo-highlight-code language=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;
          &lt;code slot=&quot;code&quot;&gt;npm install instagram-private-api&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/deckgo-highlight-code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then you can use the following code to post your pictures. Make sure, the pictures are in proper resolution and aspect ratio. Instagram supports the aspect ratio of &lt;code&gt;4:5&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;1.91:1&lt;/code&gt;. If your images are not in this resolution, you might get an error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;deckgo-highlight-code language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;
          &lt;code slot=&quot;code&quot;&gt;const { IgApiClient } = require(&amp;#x27;instagram-private-api&amp;#x27;);
const { readFile } = require(&amp;#x27;fs&amp;#x27;);
const { promisify } = require(&amp;#x27;util&amp;#x27;);
const readFileAsync = promisify(readFile);
const ig = new IgApiClient();

// Log in to your account
const auth = await ig.account.login(&amp;#x27;username&amp;#x27;, &amp;#x27;password&amp;#x27;);

// Post the image
const publishResult = await ig.publish.photo({
  file: await readFileAsync(&amp;#x27;path-to-image.jpg&amp;#x27;),
  caption: &amp;#x27;Hello World&amp;#x27;,
});&lt;/code&gt;

It can be easily done with a line of code. This approach can be used in any programming language. Since I’m kinda comfortable with Javascript I’ve used JS code here. Please feel free to let me know your feedback and suggestions in the comments section. This article will help us understand how to select a random value from an array of values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting a random number is easy. You just need to call Math.random() and it will produce a random decimal between 0 and 1 (exclusive). You just need to multiply it with the upper limit of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to use &lt;code&gt;Math.random()&lt;/code&gt; and select a random value from an array?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is simple, we just get a random index between 0 and array’s length and pick a value using that index. But the catch here is that Math.random() gives us a decimal with greater precision so we floor the random number to an integer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is simple, we just get a random index between 0 and array’s length and pick a value using that index. But the catch here is that Math.random() gives us a decimal with greater precision so we floor the random number to an integer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider this code snippet,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;deckgo-highlight-code language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;
          &lt;code slot=&quot;code&quot;&gt;const arr = [&amp;#x27;apple&amp;#x27;, &amp;#x27;orange&amp;#x27;, &amp;#x27;pineapple&amp;#x27;, &amp;#x27;banana&amp;#x27;, &amp;#x27;grapes&amp;#x27;];

// The code for picking a random value from an array is quite simple
const randomValue = arr[Math.floor(Math. random() * arr.length)];&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/deckgo-highlight-code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breaking the code&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Math.floor()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – Returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Math.random()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – Returns a decimal between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Math.floor(Math. random() * arr.length)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – Return a random number between 0 and arr.length -1 (because Math.floor is used). We then use this random number as an index for picking an element from the array.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Working Example&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a working CodePen to select a random value from an array. You can click the button to obtain a random value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-testid=&quot;general-observer&quot; class=&quot;mdx-embed&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;height:500px;width:100%&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pro tip:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want a value to be repeated often or you wanted to give more weight to a particular value, repeat that value two or more times in the array. For example, if you want more &lt;code&gt;apple&lt;/code&gt; returned while getting random values, use &lt;code&gt;apple&lt;/code&gt; twice or thrice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;deckgo-highlight-code language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;
          &lt;code slot=&quot;code&quot;&gt;const arr = [&amp;#x27;apple&amp;#x27;, &amp;#x27;apple&amp;#x27;, &amp;#x27;apple&amp;#x27;, &amp;#x27;orange&amp;#x27;, &amp;#x27;pineapple&amp;#x27;, &amp;#x27;banana&amp;#x27;, &amp;#x27;grapes&amp;#x27;];&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/deckgo-highlight-code&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this way, you will get more apples returned than other values. I hope this article helps you to get a random value from an array of values.

Here we go…!
Booking a ticket in Tatkal? Ordering a phone in Flipkart? The counter closes in a flash. Boom! Here it comes. Baam! There it goes. The offer ends before you wink your eyes. Feeling bored by doing the same task again and again? Leave your worries; Bookmarklet is there by your side. With it, you can automate almost everything on the web. Computers are so much faster than humans before your eyes could process the information in the web page and locate the submit button, Bookmarklet completes your job. Okay let me unravel the mystery of Bookmarklet to you, Brace yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bookmarklets’ are nothing but a useful piece of code that can run on any loaded web page. This useful piece of code is written in JavaScript. If you know the basics of JS, you are almost on the top of everything. The name Bookmarklet is coined because this script resides on a bookmark. Any browser will surely have a facility to bookmark your favorite sites. Behind this facility, there is a grand opening to the world of automation of the web using JS. Let us go discover the creation of Bookmarklets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to the bookmark bar and add a new bookmark. Name it whatever you want, Tatkal booker, Instant phone buyer, the Web Robo. Then in the URL enter the following code given here along with your own JavaScript code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;deckgo-highlight-code language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;
          &lt;code slot=&quot;code&quot;&gt;javascript:(function(){ //your JavaScript code here })()&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/deckgo-highlight-code&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can add any code to this function and this will be executed on any loaded page the moment you click this bookmark. This is nothing but an anonymous JS function, nothing special in it. Most of the computer guys might know it. The power of the Bookmarklet is immeasurable. You can import any JS library from the CDNs’ and use them in the script. With the gift of JQuery you could almost implement any automation tasks on the web with swag, just like Selenium but without using it actually. No more late bookings and boring stuff, just Bookmarklets. Go now and start creating your own Bookmarklet. May the force be with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A simple Bookmarklet to log in to an application&lt;/strong&gt; (might be useful if you debug a web-application 100 times/day like me)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;deckgo-highlight-code language=&quot;js&quot;&gt;
          &lt;code slot=&quot;code&quot;&gt;javascript:(function(){document.getElementById(&amp;quot;loginEmail”).value=”Your username”; document.getElementById(“password”).value=”Your password”; document.getElementById(“submit”).click();})()&lt;/code&gt;
        &lt;/deckgo-highlight-code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps people in web development field who feel bored to type their long username and password (known to the whole organization) again and again to login to their application with a quick click. If you are lazy even to do that click, you will surely find a way to automate even that as well. I felt logging in again and again to my application boring, that’s when I found this precious jewel “Bookmarklets”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
