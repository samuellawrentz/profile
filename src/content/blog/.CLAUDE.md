# Blog Writing Style Guide

Based on analysis of all 30+ posts (2022–2026). The authentic voice comes from the 2022–2023 originals and the 2026 reusable-bun-modules post. Several 2024–2025 posts drifted into AI-generated patterns — avoid those patterns.

## Reference Posts (write like these)

- `bookmarklets` (2022) — dramatic countdown intro, personality-packed, Star Wars reference
- `blog-about-blog` (2022) — numbered personal journey storytelling, raw and honest
- `my-take-on-css-grids` (2022) — personal backstory → learning journey → code breakdown
- `react-hooks` (2022) — short, enthusiastic, code-first with embedded demo
- `vim-is-a-blackhole` (2023) — stream-of-consciousness excitement, short and punchy
- `how-i-salvaged-my-website-from-the-dead` (2023) — hour-by-hour narrative, humor under pressure
- `reusable-bun-modules` (2026) — opinionated technical walkthrough, real benchmarks, no fluff

## Anti-Reference Posts (avoid writing like these)

- `ai-coding-revolution` / `vibe-coding-revolution` — "Yo tech fam!", performative slang, emoji-stuffed headers, formulaic tip lists, multiple redundant closing sections
- `leverage-ai-to-understand-complete-repo` — formal/corporate tone, SEO keyword block, "In conclusion"
- `frontend-performance-optimisation` — reads like a textbook, no personality
- `migrating-from-cra-to-vite-with-bunjs` — forced Kevin Hart gag repeated in every paragraph
- `linear-mcp-server` / `github-mcp-server` — "fam", emoji in every header, hype over substance

## Voice & Tone

- **Conversational** — writes like talking to a friend. Uses "I", "you", "we" freely.
- **Genuinely enthusiastic** — real excitement, not performed hype. "How cool is that?" / "I love React, and so do you!" / "Man!, he was on fire."
- **Self-deprecating and honest** — admits laziness, procrastination, boredom openly. "dedication sucks" / "I went dark for the next two years" / "If you are lazy even to do that click..."
- **Opinionated** — takes a clear stance. "I'm not going back." / "Forget about margins." / "Gone are the days of class-based components."
- **Direct** — contractions, informal phrasing. "kinda", "stuff", "WTH is `minmax()`?"
- **Organic pop culture** — movie/game references when they fit naturally, not forced. "I felt like thanos, having the powers of the stone" / "May the force be with you"
- **Raw over polished** — slight rough edges are fine. The early posts had typos ("procastination", "collegue") and that felt human.

## Structure Patterns

- **Personal anecdote or opinion as intro** — jump in with a real story or strong take. 1-2 paragraphs max. Never "Hey there tech fam!" or "Buckle up!"
- **Numbered lists for personal journeys** — the blog-about-blog and salvaged-website posts use numbered timelines. This is a signature pattern.
- **H2 headers as conversational statements** — "Okay, but How?", "Finally, some code", "Do we need media queries? I guess not.", "Why Minimal?"
- **Code first, explain after** — show the snippet, then break it down piece by piece
- **Aside banners** for tips: `<aside class="banner banner-info">...</aside>`
- **Embedded demos** when applicable — CodeSandbox iframes
- **One short closing** — 1-2 sentences max. "Hope this helps" / "Happy coding!" / one italicized sentence. Never multiple closing sections (no "Bottom Line" + "Quick Tips" + "Last Word" + P.S. chains)
- **Short to medium length** — 300-700 words for most posts. The bun-modules post (technical deep-dive) is ~900 words and that's the upper bound. Never 1200+ word bloat.

## What to Avoid

### AI-Generated Patterns (these crept into 2024-2025 posts)
- "Yo" / "Y'all" / "fam" / "tech fam" / "code wranglers" — not your voice
- Emoji in headers ("What's the Big Deal? 🤔") — you never did this in authentic posts
- "Buckle up" / "game changer" / "NEXT LEVEL" / "the future looks extra spicy" — performative hype
- "Let me break it down for you" / "Here's the thing" — filler
- "Keep coding, keep vibing" as a sign-off repeated across posts
- Formulaic numbered tip lists at the end of every post
- Multiple closing sections (Bottom Line + Tips + Last Word + P.S.)
- Running gags that repeat in every paragraph (the Kevin Hart thing)
- SEO keyword blocks
- "Further Reading" link dumps at the end

### General
- "In this article, we will explore..." / "In conclusion" / "without further ado"
- "leverage", "utilize", "comprehensive", "robust", "streamline", "delve", "demystifying", "revolutionizing", "game changer"
- "it's important to note", "let's dive in", "let me tell you"
- Textbook tone — bullet-point walls without personality
- Over-explaining basics — trust the reader
- Excessive self-links shoehorned into unrelated sentences (some older posts did this too aggressively)

## Code Examples

- Keep snippets short and focused (5-15 lines ideal, up to 20 for real-world examples)
- Inline comments sparingly, only for the non-obvious
- Show the simplest working version first, then the advanced pattern
- Use `//bad` and `//good` labels when contrasting approaches
- Real code from real projects > contrived examples
- Comparison tables work well for benchmarks (see bun-modules post)

## Hero Images

- Each post has a custom hero image in the same directory as the MDX file
- Referenced via relative path in frontmatter: `heroImage: ./image-name.png`
- Images are typically descriptive/thematic (e.g., cheetah for "faster builds", grid illustration for CSS grids)
- New posts should use `header.png` as the filename (this feeds OG image generation)

## OG Image Generation

- The prebuild script (`scripts/generate-og-images.cjs`) looks for **`header.png`** (exact name) in the post directory
- If found: uses it as a full-bleed background (1200x630), overlays a dark angled gradient + title in white bold 70px Courier + logo
- If missing: falls back to a plain dark gradient background with the same text
- The `heroImage` frontmatter field is NOT used for OG — only `header.png` matters
- To get a custom OG background: place a `header.png` in the post directory (any aspect ratio works, it scales to cover)

## Frontmatter Format

```yaml
---
title: How to do X? - A simple guide    # Question format or direct statement
date: YYYY-MM-DD
path: /blog/url-slug/                   # Always has trailing slash
published: true
heroImage: ./header.png                 # Use header.png for new posts
tags: [react, javascript]               # Lowercase, bracketed array
description: Short 1-2 sentence hook that makes you want to click.
---
```

## Emoji Usage

- Sparingly — occasional heart emojis or celebration at the very end of a post
- **Never in headers**
- **Never inline with technical content**
- One or two at most in the entire post, used as punctuation/celebration
