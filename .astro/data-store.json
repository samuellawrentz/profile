Click to read more.","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./pagespeed.jpg",true,"Everyone loves speed - be it cars, superbikes, or websites. A good website (like this one 😉) loads content within the blink of an eye. A fast website can generate a lot of traffic easily. Users feel energetic and comfortable in using a website that responds quickly to their inputs. To measure the speed and performance, you need to be introduced to PageSpeed.\n\n## PageSpeed ⚡️\n[PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/get-started) is a google metric that helps developers and businesses to find out how their website performs and loads on different devices and conditions. A good website must have a PageSpeed above 90, where 100 is the best. For example, my website's pagespeed is almost 95-98, you can check it out [here](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/monitor-website-pagespeed-with-googlesheets/).\n\nThe PageSpeed of this website is almost 95-98. I'm planning to make it 100 soon, stay tuned.\n\n![This sites Pagespeed](./pagespeed.png)\n\nYou can get the speed insights of your website here - [Google PageSpeed Insigts](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)\n\n\u003Caside class=\"banner banner-info\">There are a few ways to improve PageSpeed, but it's a topic for another post.\u003C/aside>\n\n\n### PageSpeed API\nThis API is provided by google so that you can fetch your PageSpeed scores programmatically using the API. To get started, you have to create a google project and [enable API usage.](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) You will get an **API Key**. This is required to make API calls to the google PageSpeed server. Google has a free tier so cost shouldn't be a concern.\n\n## Google Sheets Apps Script\nGoogle sheet has a section that allows you to write scripts that can be triggered automatically. The syntax looks like plain Javascript, but its called [Apps Script or Google Script](https://www.google.com/script/start/). You can find it in Extensions > Apps Script. For tips and tricks about coding standards, you can refer to this [post](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged).\n\n### Ok fine, How do we do the monitoring part?\nYou can make an API call to fetch the PageSpeed data and then write it to the last row in the sheet once everyday. In this manner, we can have a track of daily PageSpeed data and it can be used for further analytics. To understand the importance of analytics, you can refer to my [post](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/gatsby-incremental-faster-builds-github-actions/) on Gatsby incremental faster builds with Github actions.\n\nYou can even set up a mail alert if the PageSpeed goes than, say 80 *(I'm leaving it upto you, my fellow developer)*. The AppsScript code is as follows, put it in the `Code.gs` file in the script editor.\n\n```js\n// Code.gs\n\n// You can insert all the pages that you want to monitor into this array.\nvar urls = ['www.samuellawrentz.com'];\nvar lastRow = 0;\n\nfunction initialize(){\n  lastRow = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet().getLastRow() + 1;\n  var dateCell = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet().getRange(lastRow, 1);\n  \n  // Set the date on the first column\n  dateCell.setValue(new Date()).setNumberFormat(\"dd/MM/yyyy\");\n  urls.forEach(function(item, index){\n  myFunction(item, index)\n});\n}\n\n\nfunction myFunction(url, index) {\n  var url = 'https://www.googleapis.com/pagespeedonline/v5/runPagespeed?url=https%3A%2F%2F'+ encodeURIComponent(url)+'&category=performance&key=YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE';\n  var options = {\n    'method': 'get'\n  };\n  var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url, options);\n  addData(response, index);\n}\n\n// Write the data to the next row to the last filled row\nfunction addData(response, index) {\n  var res = JSON.parse(response.getContentText());\n  var cell = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet().getRange(lastRow, index + 2);\n  cell.setValue(res.lighthouseResult.categories.performance.score * 100);\n  \n}\n```\nSet up a trigger *(can be found on the left side bar of the editor)* that fires every day at midnight. You can see this script doing its work automatically every night for you. You can look at my google sheet for reference - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15O2yPtvmFZvEEaxoZqpR-LksZ7CQR9SJjC5WETNgtaU/edit?usp=sharing\n\nAs you can see, I started the script recently. I'm planning to use the data for further analysis and produce historical charts later down the road.

Picture this: You're sitting at your desk, staring at your code editor like it's written in ancient hieroglyphics. Sound familiar? Well, hold onto your coffee mugs because we're diving headfirst into the AI coding revolution that's turning developers into vibe coders!\n\n## The Language Barrier is Crumbling\n\nRemember spending countless hours wrestling with syntax, memorizing APIs, and Googling \"how to loop through an array in [insert language here]\"? Those days are becoming a beautiful memory. AI coding assistants are making language fluency as easy as ordering coffee.\n\n**You just need the idea** - the implementation details? Let AI handle that for you. Whether it's Python, TypeScript, Rust, or that obscure language your company's legacy system runs on, AI's got your back.\n\n## What is Vibe Coding?\n\nLet me break it down for you. Vibe coding = coding without worrying about code, optimizations, implementations. It's like having a conversation with a senior developer who's had way too much coffee and knows every language fluently.\n\nInstead of:\n\n```javascript\n// *Stares at screen for 3 hours*\n// *Questions entire career*\n// *Googles basic syntax for the 50th time*\nfunction complexImplementation() {\n  // implementation that might not work\n}\n```\n\nYou get to:\n\n```javascript\n// Just tell your AI:\n\"I need a React component that fetches user data and displays it in a responsive grid with smooth animations\";\n// And vibe while AI does the heavy lifting!\n```\n\n## Multiple AI Models = More Power\n\nThe best part? You're not stuck with one AI overlord. Multiple inference providers help you try out different models. Some days you might vibe with GitHub Copilot, other days with Cursor, and when you're feeling extra fancy - Claude or ChatGPT.\n\nFrom my experience:\n\n- **Anthropic's Sonnet 4** - Great for complex logic and refactoring\n- **GPT-5** - Excellent for creative solutions and debugging\n- **Qwen Coder 480b** - Superb for understanding legacy codebases\n\nEach model has its own vibe, and switching between them is like changing radio stations until you find the perfect jam for your coding session.\n\n## Real Talk: The Developer Experience\n\nLet's keep it 100 - vibe coding isn't about replacing developers with robots. It's about enhancing our capabilities like a power-up in a video game. Here's what actually changes:\n\n### Project Setup\n\nInstead of spending hours on boilerplate configurations, you just describe your dream setup and AI generates it. It's like having a genie, but for package.json files.\n\n### Feature Implementation\n\nFocus on the what and why, let AI handle the how. Your mental energy goes from \"how do I implement this\" to \"what should this feature accomplish.\"\n\n### Bug Fixing\n\nAI analyzes your code faster than you can say \"it works on my machine.\" It's like having a debugging buddy who never gets tired of hearing you complain about undefined variables.\n\n### Code Reviews\n\nGet instant feedback that's actually constructive, not just \"this looks fine\" from your teammate who's clearly not reading it.\n\n## The Learning Curve is Actually Fun\n\nTraditional coding learning curves look like Mount Everest - steep and unforgiving. Vibe coding smooths that out like a freshly paved highway.\n\nYou still need to understand:\n\n- **Logic flow** - AI can't think for you\n- **Architecture decisions** - You're the captain of this ship\n- **Problem-solving skills** - AI helps, but you steer\n\nBut now you can spend more time on the creative aspects and less time on syntax battles.\n\n## Tools That Make It Happen\n\nYour vibe coding toolkit includes:\n\n- [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) - Your AI-powered IDE\n- [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com) - Inline suggestions that actually help\n- [Claude](https://claude.ai) - For those \"explain this codebase\" moments\n- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) - Creative problem-solving partner\n\n## But Keep It Real\n\nBefore you start thinking we're all gonna be replaced by AI, remember: vibe coding is like having a super-smart intern. It helps you work faster, but you still need to know what you're doing. AI understands your intent better when you understand your own code.\n\n## The Future Vibe\n\nThe future looks extra spicy:\n\n- AI that understands your coding style better than your rubber duck\n- Prototyping faster than product managers can change requirements\n- Debugging sessions that end in victories, not defeats\n- Code generation that feels like creative writing\n\n## Quick Tips for Vibe Coding\n\n1. **Start small** - Use AI for simple functions first\n2. **Be specific** - \"Create a login form\" vs \"Build a React component with email and password inputs, validation, and submit handler\"\n3. **Always review** - AI code needs human oversight\n4. **Keep learning** - Don't let AI make you lazy about fundamentals\n5. **Experiment with models** - Find your perfect coding match\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nAI isn't changing coding - it's elevating it. We're moving from \"code mechanics\" to \"code architects.\" The tedious stuff gets automated, leaving us to focus on innovation and creativity.\n\nWhether you're a seasoned dev who remembers when jQuery was revolutionary, or a newcomer wondering why there are so many ways to declare a variable, AI coding is democratizing software development. It's making the field more accessible, more efficient, and dare I say... more fun?\n\nSo go ahead, embrace the vibe. Let AI handle the syntax while you handle the symphony. The future of coding is here, and it's surprisingly chill. 🚀\n\n---\n\n_Keep coding, keep vibing, and most importantly, keep learning!_ 🎯\n\nP.S.

It looks kinda cool when people are able to see your work around the globe. So the journey is as follows, Imagine you are in the year 2017\n1. [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com) was the josh, wherever I turn I was seeing wordpress blogs. I'm not the one against wordpress, but somehow I wanted to have complete control over my website, not just the content.\n2. I started a wordpress blog back when I was in college in 2017 - [Towards Infinity](https://samuellawrentzz.wordpress.com). I was a philosopher back then. I used to write about life and all the other things.\n3. Things were going good, then I got a job, moved into web development team, got to know about a lot of people. I posted my first tech article on a website called [Efficient User](https://efficientuser.com) - a blog maintained by my senior collegue.\n4. I instantly felt awesome to write about tech and the things I know, so after few days, I began thinking about my own domain and own blog and stuff.\n5. But they were just thoughts, they were never made into actions. Then suddenly I got the flame one day and purchased this domain - samuellawrentz.com and purchased a hosting plan at [Hostlinger](https://hostlinger.com) (which I regret till now)\n6. They had this wordpress hosting - 4 year plan, which I brought with full energy.\n7. I started my tech blog officially on the year 2020. It was a basic Wordpress site loaded with big ass plugins. I felt like thanos, having the powers of the stone.\n8. I took a decision to write regularly, but hey, dedication sucks. I went dark for the next two years.\n9. Now again, I've got the flame, this time much stronger. I created this blog from scratch, taking reference and inspiration from various other blogs. I created my [portfolio website](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/vim-experience-nvim-dev-experience/).\n\t- The **PageSpeed** is almost 100, and you can [monitor website pagespeed with googlesheets](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/monitor-website-pagespeed-with-googlesheets/)\n\t- The page size is maximum **22kb**\n\t- The design is sleek\n\t- I have full control over what gets shown\n\t- It's **React** and **GatsbyJS**. You can learn some [coding standards with husky, typescript and lint-staged](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged) to make your React and GatsbyJS code better.\n\t- I feel great\n10.

This useful piece of code is written in JavaScript. If you know the basics of JS, you are almost on the top of everything. The name Bookmarklet is coined because this script resides on a bookmark. Any browser will surely have a facility to bookmark your favorite sites. Behind this facility, there is a grand opening to the world of automation of the web using JS. Let us go discover the creation of Bookmarklets.\n\nGo to the bookmark bar and add a new bookmark. Name it whatever you want, Tatkal booker, Instant phone buyer, the Web Robo. Then in the URL enter the following code given here along with your own JavaScript code.\n\n```js\njavascript:(function(){ //your JavaScript code here })()\n```\n\nYou can add any code to this function and this will be executed on any loaded page the moment you click this bookmark. This is nothing but an anonymous JS function, nothing special in it. Most of the computer guys might know it. The power of the Bookmarklet is immeasurable. You can import any JS library from the CDNs’ and use them in the script. With the gift of JQuery you could almost implement any automation tasks on the web with swag, just like Selenium but without using it actually.

Improve performance, simplify your code, and make your app faster. Read now!","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./cheetah.png","React, like a high-speed jet ski, boasts of its reactive state variables and props that allow you to zip around your app with lightning-fast agility. But what if I told you that you could make your app even faster? Get ready to strap on your racing goggles as we dive into the world of computed variables.\n\n## Computed Variables in React\nIn React, a computed variable is a value that is derived from or computed based on one or more state variables. It is similar to a computed property in other frameworks, such as Vue.js or Knockout.js. Computed variables are created using hooks like [useMemo](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/mastering-memoization-usememo) or useCallback, and their value is only recomputed when their dependencies change. This allows for a more efficient rendering process, since the component doesn't need to re-render every time a state variable changes, but only when the computed variable changes. In other words, computed variables act as a kind of pit stop, where the component can swap out a slow state variable for a speedy computed one. This can help eliminate unnecessary re-renders and make your app faster than a cheetah on a jet ski, especially in complex applications where performance is critical.\n\n## Some code please\nLet's take a look at an example. Say you have a component that renders a list of items, and you want to display the total number of items in the list. You could use a computed variable to achieve this:\n\n```js\nconst [items, setItems] = useState([]);\n\n// usememo is not necessary here, but it's good practice\n// if itemCount is a computation heavy value, we can memoize it\nconst itemCount = useMemo(() => items.length, [items]);\n```\n\nBy using `useMemo`, we can create a memoized version of the `itemCount` variable. This means that the value of `itemCount` will only be computed when the `items` state variable changes, which can help [eliminate unnecessary re-renders](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/avoid-re-renders-react-memo) and make your app faster than a jet-propelled cheetah.\n\n## Conclusion: The Fast and the Furious\nIn conclusion, computed variables can help make your React app faster than a cheetah on a jet ski. By identifying which state variables are computed values and replacing them with normal variables, you can improve your app's performance and leave your competitors in the dust. So, buckle up and get ready to leave your competition in the rear-view mirror with these [React performance optimisation techniques and coding standards](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged)!","src/content/blog/computed-states-in-react/index.mdx",[90],"./cheetah.png","edb51a2f765ab773","faster-build-gatsby",{"id":92,"data":94,"body":101,"filePath":102,"assetImports":103,"digest":105,"deferredRender":22},{"title":95,"date":96,"path":97,"tags":98,"description":99,"heroImage":100,"published":22,"type":9},"How to cache your Gatsby site for faster builds in Github Actions?",["Date","2022-08-05T00:00:00.000Z"],"/blog/gatsby-incremental-faster-builds-github-actions/",[53],"We all start small, but once our content grows, soon we'll be finding ourselves with 300 pages at hand.

If you want to learn more about my experience with Gatsby, you can check out my other blog posts about [Gatsby and incremental faster builds](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/gatsby-incremental-faster-builds-github-actions/). This is the 6th blog post here on this website and if you try sharing this blog post on the internet you would see a image with the title. This image is called the OG image.\n\n## What is an OG image?\nOpen Graph Images is a simple way to add images to your posts. An open graph image or OG image is the image that appears when you post a link to a web page or video content on your social media sites. This forms part of an important group of meta tags that directly impact how the content links perform on social media platforms. \n\n\u003Caside class=\"banner banner-info\">Try sharing this link on twitter or linkedin, you would find the OG being rendered.\u003C/aside>\n\n## GatsbyJS and OG images\nGatsby ecosystem is growing everyday and new plugins popup every day. There are few plugins which creates OG images from HTML/JSX content. These plugins use [`pupeteer`](https://pptr.dev/) to load that HTML content and then it takes a screenshot of the page and then saves it as a `.png`. It is a quite awesome plugin. \n\n### Pupeteer\n`pupeteer` is nothing but a Chrome browser that runs headlessly and there are options to integrate the live chrome browser as well. The issue with this thing is that, it takes `~280mb` to run and I'm personally a person who doesn't like apps or bundles that takes a lot of space. Eventhough `pupeteer` is a dev dependency, I wanted a simple solution to generate my OG images.\n\n## The solution\nAfter doing some intensive google searches, I figured out there is actually another way to create OG images - **The canvas way**. Why to use a heavy package as `pupeteer` when you just want a canvas that can be exported as a PNG image. Then I came across this package called `node-canvas` which does the same thing as HTML canvas but it does it in nodeJS, so that you don't need to fire up a browser inorder to screenshot your page. \n\n![Generated Image](./07407175-d0dc-51f4-9df7-ae572692cbba.png \"The Gatsby OG image generated using node canvas\")\n\nThe above image was generated using the following code and its the OG image for this blog.\n\n### Integrating [`node-canvas`](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) into the Gatsby Ecosystem\nIt is time to implement our idea. This is where the concept of `plugins` come into picture. If you're interested in how plugins work and contribute to the coding standards, you can check out my [coding standards blog post](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged).\n\n#### Gatsby Plugins\nGatsby has almost 3000 plugins for each of your requirement be it meta tags, RSS feeds, image optimization, etc. These plugins tap into your website content/data and then create assets or does stuff that you want to before build, post build, etc. \n\n#### The plugin\nA local plugin can be created by creating a folder with package.json in it. The code goes into the `gatsby-node.js` file. You can also learn more about creating plugins and how they can be used in your workflow by checking out my [Jira Git Commit Workflow VSCode Extension](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/jira-git-commit-workflow-vscode-extension/) blog post.\n\n```js\n// plugins/gatsby-node.js\nconst canvas = require('../../canvas.js')\nconst fs = require('fs')\nconst path = require('path')\nexports.createPages = async ({ actions, graphql }) => {\n\tconst folderpath = './public/og-images'\n\tif (!fs.existsSync(folderpath)) \n          fs.mkdirSync(path.resolve(folderpath))\n\tconst result = await graphql(`{{query}}`)\n\n if (result.errors) {\n\tconsole.error(errors)\n\treturn console.error({ ...result.errors })\n\t}\n\n\tconst posts = result.data.allMdx.nodes\n\n\tfor (const node of posts) {\n\tcanvas.gen(node.frontmatter.title, node.id)\n\t}\n}\n```\nThis code is nothing but a simple graphQL query which returns you the list of posts and then renders an OF image using the title of each post.\n\n## The Canvas\n\nCanvas is a very fun thing to work in the HTML world. Canvas is pretty useful to do paint related stuff in browser. Thanks to `node-canvas` we now have the capablity to play with canvas even on `node` environments.\n\nThe code for generating canvas can be found below. You can play with the canvas. This is the code that generates my OG images on the fly.\n\n```js\n// canvas.js\nconst { createCanvas, loadImage } = require('canvas')\nconst fs = require('fs')\nconst path = require('path')\n// Size for the OG image\nconst canvas = createCanvas(1200, 630)\nconst ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')\n\nlet drawCircle = function (x, y, d) {\n  // Draw circle\n};\n\n\nexports.gen = function gen(title, id) {\n\n\n  // Linear Gradient\n  var grd = ctx.createLinearGradient(0, 0, 1200, 630);\n  grd.addColorStop(0, 'hsl(' + 360 * Math.random() + ',70%,60%)');\n  grd.addColorStop(1, 'hsl(' + 360 * Math.random() + ',100%,30%)');\n  ctx.fillStyle = grd;\n  ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 1200, 630);\n  const noOfSircles = Math.ceil(Math.random() * 7)\n  const noOfRect = Math.ceil(Math.random() * 7)\n  // Set fontstyle\n  ctx.font = '900 70px Courier';\n  ctx.fillStyle = 'white';\n  d\n  // call helper method to get number of lines\n  const lines = getLines(ctx, title, 1080)\n  lines.forEach((line, i) => ctx.fillText(line, 60, 580 - (80 * (lines.length - i))))\n  // Set fontstyle\n  ctx.font = '48px Courier';\n  ctx.fillText('{{Author Name}}', 60, 120)\n  ctx.font = '100 24px Courier';\n  ctx.fillText('{{slogan}}', 60, 150)\n\n  const buffer = canvas.toBuffer('image/png')\n  console.info('Generating for', id)\n  // write as .png\n  fs.writeFileSync(path.resolve(`./public/og-images/${id}.png`), buffer)\n}\n\n```\n\nThat is how the OG image for this blog is getting generated.

Here's a few ways to boost a web apps performace and interactivity.","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./performance.jpg","As frontend developers, one of our main goals is to create fast and responsive user experiences. Poor performance can lead to a frustrating user experience and can even cause users to abandon your site or application. Therefore, it is important to prioritize [performance optimization](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/monitor-website-pagespeed-with-googlesheets/) in our development process.\n\nThere are many factors that can impact the performance of a frontend application, including the size and complexity of the code, the number and size of assets (such as images and fonts), and the efficiency of the server-side code. In this blog post, we will focus on some techniques that we can use to optimize the frontend code and assets to improve the overall performance of our application.\n\n## Minimizing the Size of Assets\nOne way to improve the performance of our application is to minimize the size of our assets, such as images, fonts, and JavaScript and CSS files. By reducing the size of these assets, we can reduce the amount of time it takes for them to be downloaded and processed by the browser. For more details, you can refer to this blog on [Gatsby Incremental Faster Builds with Github Actions](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/gatsby-incremental-faster-builds-github-actions/).\n\n#### There are several ways to minimize the size of assets:\n\n**Compress images:** Using tools such as ImageOptim or TinyPNG can significantly reduce the size of images without affecting their quality.\n\n**Minify JavaScript and CSS:** Minifying these files involves removing unnecessary characters, such as whitespace and comments, to reduce the file size. We can use tools such as UglifyJS or CSSNano to minify our JavaScript and CSS files.\n\n**Use web fonts sparingly:** Web fonts can be a useful design tool, but they can also significantly increase the size of our application. If possible, consider using system fonts or a small subset of web fonts to minimize the impact on performance.\n\n## Lazy Loading\nLazy loading is a technique that involves only loading assets when they are needed. This can be especially useful for large or complex applications, where it may not be practical to load all assets upfront. By lazy loading assets, we can improve the initial load time of our application and reduce the amount of memory and processing power required to run it. For more tips on how to optimize your application, you can check out this [blog on Lazy Loading with Suspense](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/lazy-loading-with-suspense/).\n\n#### There are several ways to implement lazy loading in a frontend application:\n\n**Lazy loading images:** We can use the `loading` attribute to specify that an image should only be loaded when it is in the viewport. This can be especially useful for image-heavy pages, such as image galleries or product pages.\n\n**Lazy loading routes:** In a single-page application (SPA), we can use lazy loading to only load the assets for a specific route when the user navigates to that route. This can improve the initial load time of the application and reduce the amount of memory and processing power required to run it.\n\n## Caching\nCaching is another technique that can improve the performance of our application. By caching assets, we can reduce the number of requests made to the server and the amount of data transferred over the network. This can result in faster load times and a more responsive user experience.\n\n#### There are several ways to implement caching in a frontend application:\n\n**HTTP caching:** HTTP caching involves using `cache-control` headers to specify that certain assets should be cached by the browser. This can reduce the number of requests made to the server and improve the load time of the application.\n\n**Service workers:** Service workers are a type of JavaScript file that run in the background and can be used to cache assets for offline use. This can be especially useful for applications that need to work offline or in low connectivity environments.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn conclusion, performance optimization is an important aspect of frontend development. By minimizing the size of assets, lazy loading, and caching, we can create faster and more responsive user experiences. While there are many techniques that we can use to optimize the performance of our application, it is important to strike a balance between performance and functionality. By carefully considering the trade-offs between performance and features, we can create high-performing applications that meet the needs of our users.

Because your terminal should look good and work smoothly.","Hey there! So I've been using [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) for a while now, and it's quickly become my go-to terminal emulator. Not because it's flashy or has a million features, but because it does exactly what I need - fast, clean, and gets out of my way.\n\n## Why Ghostty Though?\n\nLook, I'm not here to sell you on another terminal emulator. There are plenty of great options out there - iTerm2, Alacritty, Kitty. But Ghostty hits a sweet spot: it's blazingly fast (written in Zig), GPU-accelerated, and has sane defaults. Plus, the configuration is dead simple.\n\nThe real kicker? It just works. No weird rendering bugs, no lag when you're tailing massive log files, and it plays nice with tmux - which is essential for my workflow.\n\n## The Config Breakdown\n\nHere's my minimal Ghostty config. It's focused on two things: looking good and working seamlessly with tmux.\n\n```bash\n# tmux integration - send save-buffer command\nkeybind = cmd+s=text:\\x01\\x73\n\n# tmux prefix to toggle zoom on current pane\nkeybind = cmd+b=text:\\x01\\x7a\n\n# aesthetics\nbackground-opacity = 0.85\nbackground-blur=16\nbackground=#000000\nmacos-titlebar-style = hidden\n\n# typography\nfont-size=16\nfont-thicken=true\nfont-thicken-strength=1\nadjust-cell-height=1\n```\n\n### tmux Keybindings\n\nThe first two lines are all about tmux integration:\n\n- `cmd+s` sends `Ctrl-a s` to tmux (my prefix is `Ctrl-a`), which triggers save-buffer in my tmux config\n- `cmd+b` sends `Ctrl-a z` to zoom/unzoom the current pane - super handy when you need to focus\n\nThese keybindings let me stay in macOS keyboard land while controlling tmux seamlessly.\n\n### Visual Polish\n\nThe aesthetic settings create that nice translucent terminal look:\n\n- **85% opacity** with **16px blur** gives you just enough background visibility without being distracting\n- **Hidden titlebar** maximizes screen real estate - every pixel counts when you're coding\n- **Pure black background** (`#000000`) looks clean and reduces eye strain during late-night sessions\n\n### Typography Tweaks\n\nFont rendering matters more than you think:\n\n- **16pt font size** - comfortable for extended coding sessions\n- **Font thickening** - makes text crisper and easier to read on retina displays\n- **Cell height adjustment** - adds subtle breathing room between lines\n\n## Why Minimal?\n\nI've seen terminal configs that are hundreds of lines long. Custom themes, complex keybindings for every possible scenario, plugins, and scripts. That's cool if it works for you, but I prefer keeping things simple.\n\nThis config gives me everything I need: good looks, smooth tmux integration, and readable text. Everything else is just noise.\n\n### Screenshot of my terminal\n\n![My terminal with the minimal config](./ghostty-1.png)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo use this config, just drop it in `~/.config/ghostty/config`. Ghostty will pick it up automatically on next launch.\n\nIf you're new to Ghostty, check out the [official documentation](https://ghostty.org/docs) - it's actually pretty well-written and won't make you want to pull your hair out.\n\nAnd if you're into terminal customization, you might enjoy my posts on [Vim LSP configuration](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/vim-lsp-hover-borders/) and [Neovim optimization](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/vim-experience-nvim-dev-experience/).\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nGhostty is fast, simple, and gets out of your way. This config makes it look good and work smoothly with tmux. That's it. No magic, no complexity - just a solid terminal setup that works.\n\nHappy terminal-ing! 🚀","src/content/blog/ghostty-config/index.md",[150,44],"./ghostty-1.png","bcdf4536a780479a",{"html":153,"metadata":154},"\u003Cp>Hey there!

The author shares the configuration process for these tools and provides a workaround for submodules. This approach ensures linting and formatting happens before each commit for better code quality.","Typescript is a great tool to enforce coding standards and it helps in removing most of the buggy code beforehand. But it is not enough, we need to have a way to enforce coding standards across the team. We can use husky and lint-staged to enforce coding standards.\n\n## ESLint\n\nJust use airbnb's eslint config. It's the best. It takes care of most of the things. It's a great starting point. You can add your own rules on top of it. Mostly you'll be removing rules because they are very strict.\n\n### Configuring ESLint\n\n1. Install eslint\n\n```bash\nbun install eslint eslint-config-airbnb-typescript eslint-config-airbnb -D\n```\n\n2. Add a eslint.cofig.js file to configure ESLint.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  parser: \"@typescript-eslint/parser\",\n  extends: [\n    \"airbnb\",\n    \"airbnb-typescript\",\n    \"plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended\",\n    \"prettier\",\n  ],\n  plugins: [\"prettier\", \"@typescript-eslint\"],\n};\n```\n\n> Add other packages if you want to use them\n\nThis config should be rigid enough to enforce coding standards. But if you want to add more rules, you can add them in the config file. Once you do this, you would start seeing lot of errors. Running `eslint --fix-all` would fix 90% of the issues. So don't panic.\n\n## Husky\n\nIs a tool that helps in running scripts before git commands. We can use it to run scripts before commit, push, etc. We can use it to run tests before commit, run lint before push, etc. This helps to run any npx, bunx commands that we want to, or heck even a `.sh` file.\n\n### Configuring husky\n\n1. Install husky\n\n```bash\nbun install husky --save-dev\n```\n\n2. Add husky to `package.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"husky\": \"^8.0.0\"\n  },\n  \"husky\": {\n    \"hooks\": {\n      \"pre-commit\": \"bun run lint-staged\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"lint-staged\": \"lint-staged\",\n    \"prepare\": \"husky install\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> If you are using bun, it's best to add `husky install` to `postinstall` or the `prepare` script in `package.json`. This will automatically install husky when you install the package and ensures that everyone in your team has husky installed.\n\n> Note: Bun does not print the output of the scripts\n\nThis would add a folder `.husky` to the root of the project. This folder contains the scripts that husky runs before the git commands.\n\n3. In that folder, there would be a file `pre-commit`. This file contains the script that husky runs before the commit command. We can add any script that we want to run before the commit command.\n\n```bash\n# Add this to the end of the file\nnpx lint-staged\n```\n\n## Lint-staged\n\nLint-staged is a tool that helps in running scripts on staged files. We can use it to run lint on staged files, run tests on staged files, etc. This helps in running scripts on the files that are staged for commit. Also it only runs on staged files, so every commit would have proper changes.\n\n### Configuring lint-staged\n\n1. Install lint-staged\n\n```bash\nbun install lint-staged --save-dev\n```\n\n2. Add lint-staged to `package.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"lint-staged\": \"^11.0.0\"\n  },\n  \"lint-staged\": {\n    \"*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}\": [\"eslint --fix\", \"prettier --write\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Submodules, Husky, Lint-staged, ESLint\n\nThese don't work well together. If you are using submodules, you would have to install husky and lint-staged in the submodule as well. Also you would have to add the husky hooks to the submodule's package.json. This is because husky and lint-staged run in the context of the submodule.\n\nIf the submodule does not have a package.json it's fine, you just have to init husky in it. You can add this to the `prepare` script of your parent app.\n\n```bash\nhusky install && cd path/to/submodule && husky install\n```\n\nESLint requires a config to be present in your submodule root as well. So just create a config and extend it from your parent app.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  extends: [\"../.eslintrc.js\"],\n};\n```\n\n> You should also add a `tsconfig.json` to the submodule root. This is because husky and lint-staged run in the context of the submodule. So they would need a tsconfig.json to run the scripts. Just follow the same and extend the config from the parent app.\n\nThat's it. Now every time you commit, husky would run lint-staged and lint-staged would run eslint and prettier on the staged files. This would ensure that the code is linted and formatted before every commit.

You're working on a personal project, push to GitHub, and suddenly you're committing as your work account. Or worse, you get that dreaded \"Permission denied (publickey)\" error even though your SSH config looks perfect.\n\nIf you're juggling multiple GitHub accounts, you know the pain. Let's build a solution that actually works.\n\n## The Problem: Manual Git Profile Management\n\nAs developers, we often need to maintain separate GitHub identities:\n\n- **Personal account** for side projects and open source contributions\n- **Work account** for company projects\n- **Client accounts** for freelance work\n\nThe manual process involves:\n\n1. Updating `git config user.name` and `git config user.email`\n2. Managing multiple SSH keys\n3. Editing SSH config files\n4. Dealing with SSH agent caching issues\n\nBut here's the hidden problem that trips everyone up...\n\n## The Hidden Issue: SSH Agent Caching\n\nYou've done everything right:\n\n- Generated separate SSH keys for each account\n- Updated your `~/.ssh/config` file\n- Set the correct git user config\n\nYet you still get authentication errors. Why?\n\n**The SSH agent caches your keys and ignores your SSH config file!**\n\nWhen you run `ssh-add`, the agent remembers which key to use for GitHub.com. Even if you change your SSH config, the agent keeps using the cached key. This is why switching accounts feels like black magic.\n\n## The Solution: A Complete Profile Switcher\n\nLet's build a bash script called `gsw` (Git Switch) that handles everything:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Git Profile Switcher (gsw)\n# Switch between personal and work GitHub accounts seamlessly\n\nset -e\n\n# Configuration\nPERSONAL_NAME=\"Your Personal Name\"\nPERSONAL_EMAIL=\"personal@example.com\"\nPERSONAL_SSH_KEY=\"$HOME/.ssh/id_personal\"\n\nWORK_NAME=\"Your Work Name\"\nWORK_EMAIL=\"work@company.com\"\nWORK_SSH_KEY=\"$HOME/.ssh/id_work\"\n\n# Colors for output\nRED='\\033[0;31m'\nGREEN='\\033[0;32m'\nYELLOW='\\033[1;33m'\nNC='\\033[0m' # No Color\n\n# Function to print colored output\nprint_status() {\n    echo -e \"${GREEN}[INFO]${NC} $1\"\n}\n\nprint_warning() {\n    echo -e \"${YELLOW}[WARNING]${NC} $1\"\n}\n\nprint_error() {\n    echo -e \"${RED}[ERROR]${NC} $1\"\n}\n\n# Function to show current configuration\nshow_current_config() {\n    echo \"Current Git Configuration:\"\n    echo \"------------------------\"\n    echo \"Name: $(git config --global user.name)\"\n    echo \"Email: $(git config --global user.email)\"\n    echo \"SSH Key: $(ssh-add -l | grep github || echo 'No GitHub key in agent')\"\n    echo \"\"\n}\n\n# Function to update SSH config\nupdate_ssh_config() {\n    local profile=$1\n    local ssh_key=$2\n\n    # Backup existing config\n    cp \"$HOME/.ssh/config\" \"$HOME/.ssh/config.backup\" 2>/dev/null || true\n\n    # Remove existing GitHub entries\n    sed -i '' '/^Host github\\.com$/,/^$/d' \"$HOME/.ssh/config\" 2>/dev/null || true\n\n    # Add new GitHub configuration\n    cat >> \"$HOME/.ssh/config\" \u003C\u003C EOF\n\nHost github.com\n    HostName github.com\n    User git\n    IdentityFile $ssh_key\n    IdentitiesOnly yes\n    AddKeysToAgent yes\n\nEOF\n\n    print_status \"SSH config updated for $profile profile\"\n}\n\n# Function to switch SSH keys\nswitch_ssh_key() {\n    local ssh_key=$1\n\n    # Remove all SSH keys from agent\n    ssh-add -D 2>/dev/null || true\n\n    # Add the new key\n    ssh-add \"$ssh_key\"\n\n    print_status \"SSH key switched to $ssh_key\"\n}\n\n# Function to update git configuration\nupdate_git_config() {\n    local name=$1\n    local email=$2\n\n    git config --global user.name \"$name\"\n    git config --global user.email \"$email\"\n\n    print_status \"Git config updated: $name \u003C$email>\"\n}\n\n# Main switching logic\nswitch_profile() {\n    local profile=$1\n\n    case $profile in\n        \"personal\"|\"p\")\n            print_status \"Switching to PERSONAL profile\"\n            update_ssh_config \"personal\" \"$PERSONAL_SSH_KEY\"\n            switch_ssh_key \"$PERSONAL_SSH_KEY\"\n            update_git_config \"$PERSONAL_NAME\" \"$PERSONAL_EMAIL\"\n            ;;\n        \"work\"|\"w\")\n            print_status \"Switching to WORK profile\"\n            update_ssh_config \"work\" \"$WORK_SSH_KEY\"\n            switch_ssh_key \"$WORK_SSH_KEY\"\n            update_git_config \"$WORK_NAME\" \"$WORK_EMAIL\"\n            ;;\n        *)\n            print_error \"Unknown profile: $profile\"\n            echo \"Usage: gsw [personal|work|p|w|status]\"\n            exit 1\n            ;;\n    esac\n\n    show_current_config\n}\n\n# Function to show help\nshow_help() {\n    echo \"Git Profile Switcher (gsw)\"\n    echo \"Usage: gsw [personal|work|p|w|status|help]\"\n    echo \"\"\n    echo \"Commands:\"\n    echo \"  personal, p    Switch to personal GitHub account\"\n    echo \"  work, w        Switch to work GitHub account\"\n    echo \"  status         Show current configuration\"\n    echo \"  help           Show this help message\"\n}\n\n# Main script logic\ncase \"${1:-}\" in\n    \"personal\"|\"p\"|\"work\"|\"w\")\n        switch_profile \"$1\"\n        ;;\n    \"status\"|\"s\")\n        show_current_config\n        ;;\n    \"help\"|\"h\"|\"-h\"|\"--help\")\n        show_help\n        ;;\n    \"\")\n        print_error \"No profile specified\"\n        show_help\n        exit 1\n        ;;\n    *)\n        print_error \"Unknown command: $1\"\n        show_help\n        exit 1\n        ;;\nesac\n```\n\n## Implementation Details Explained\n\n### Why `ssh-add -D` is Critical\n\nThe `ssh-add -D` command removes **all** keys from the SSH agent. This is the magic that makes profile switching work. Without it, the agent would keep using the cached key regardless of your SSH config changes.\n\n### Using `$HOME` Instead of `~`\n\nIn bash scripts, `$HOME` is more reliable than `~` because:\n\n- `~` expansion doesn't work consistently in all contexts\n- `$HOME` works reliably in variable assignments and file paths\n- It's more explicit about what you're referencing\n\n### SSH Config Management\n\nThe script:\n\n1. Backs up your existing SSH config\n2. Removes any existing GitHub.com entries\n3. Adds a fresh configuration for the selected profile\n\nThis prevents conflicts and ensures clean switching.\n\n## Setting Up Your Environment\n\n### 1. Generate SSH Keys\n\n```bash\n# Personal key\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"personal@example.com\" -f ~/.ssh/id_personal\n\n# Work key\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"work@company.com\" -f ~/.ssh/id_work\n```\n\n### 2. Add Keys to GitHub\n\nAdd the public keys (`id_personal.pub` and `id_work.pub`) to their respective GitHub accounts.\n\n### 3. Install the Script\n\n```bash\n# Make it executable\nchmod +x gsw\n\n# Move to a directory in your PATH\nsudo mv gsw /usr/local/bin/\n```\n\n### 4. Add Aliases (Optional)\n\nAdd these to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:\n\n```bash\nalias gsw-p='gsw personal'\nalias gsw-w='gsw work'\nalias gsw-s='gsw status'\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n```bash\n# Switch to personal account\ngsw personal\n\n# Switch to work account\ngsw work\n\n# Check current configuration\ngsw status\n\n# Quick aliases\ngsw-p    # Switch to personal\ngsw-w    # Switch to work\ngsw-s    # Show status\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\n### \"Permission denied (publickey)\" Error\n\n1. Verify the SSH key exists: `ls -la ~/.ssh/id_*`\n2. Check if key is in agent: `ssh-add -l`\n3. Test connection: `ssh -T git@github.com`\n\n### Git Commit Still Shows Wrong Author\n\n1. Check global config: `git config --global --list`\n2. Check local config: `git config --local --list` (in repo directory)\n3. Remove local config if needed: `git config --local --unset user.name`\n\n### SSH Agent Not Running\n\n```bash\n# Start SSH agent\neval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\n\n# Add it to your shell profile\necho 'eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"' >> ~/.zshrc\n```\n\n## Bonus Tips\n\n### Same SSH Key on Multiple Accounts\n\nYou can use the same SSH key for multiple GitHub accounts. Just add the same public key to both accounts. The script will still work for switching git user configs.\n\n### Shell Integration\n\nAdd this function to your shell for a nice prompt indicator:\n\n```bash\n# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc\ngit_profile_prompt() {\n    local email=$(git config --global user.email)\n    if [[ $email == *\"personal\"* ]]; then\n        echo \"🏠\"\n    elif [[ $email == *\"work\"* ]]; then\n        echo \"💼\"\n    else\n        echo \"❓\"\n    fi\n}\n\n# Add to your prompt\nexport PS1='$(git_profile_prompt) '$PS1\n```\n\n### Git Hooks for Safety\n\nCreate a pre-commit hook to verify you're using the right identity:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/sh\n# .git/hooks/pre-commit\n\nREPO_EMAIL=$(git config user.email)\nGLOBAL_EMAIL=$(git config --global user.email)\n\nif [ \"$REPO_EMAIL\" != \"$GLOBAL_EMAIL\" ]; then\n    echo \"⚠️  Warning: Local git email differs from global profile\"\n    echo \"Local: $REPO_EMAIL\"\n    echo \"Global: $GLOBAL_EMAIL\"\nfi\n```\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nManaging multiple GitHub accounts doesn't have to be a headache. The key is understanding that SSH agent caching is the real culprit behind most authentication issues.\n\nWith this `gsw` script, you can:\n\n- Switch profiles instantly\n- Avoid SSH agent conflicts\n- Maintain clean git history\n- Focus on coding instead of configuration\n\nNo more \"why isn't this working?\" moments. Just clean, reliable profile switching.\n\n---\n\n_Happy coding with the right identity! 🚀_\n\nP.S.

They've taken the AI game to a whole new level with their own MCP server. If you're wondering what this means for your development workflow and how to get started with it in Cursor, buckle up - we're about to dive into this game-changing release!","Yo, what's good tech fam! 🚀 Let me tell you about something CRAZY that just dropped in the dev world. [GitHub just announced](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-04-04-github-mcp-server-public-preview/) their own Model Context Protocol (MCP) server in public preview. And let me tell you, this ain't your regular release - this is that NEXT LEVEL stuff!\n\n## What's the Big Deal? 🤔\n\nFirst off, if you're scratching your head wondering \"what's MCP?\", let me break it down for you. [Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) is like that super-smart friend who knows how to get things done. It's a standard that lets AI models talk to tools and get stuff done in the real world. Think of it as the universal translator between AI and your development tools.\n\nGitHub took Anthropic's reference server, gave it a Go makeover (yeah, they rewrote the whole thing in Go!), and added some sweet new features. We're talking:\n\n- 100% of the old server's functionality (because why fix what ain't broke?)\n- Code scanning support (keeping your code clean and secure)\n- A new `get_me` function (for that personal touch when you're asking about your stuff)\n\n## Setting Up MCP in Cursor 🎯\n\nNow, here's where it gets interesting. Setting up MCP in [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) is easier than explaining why you have 100 unused npm packages in your project. Let me show you how to configure it.\n\nYou can set up the GitHub MCP server either globally (in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`) or per project (in `.cursor/mcp.json`). Here's a complete example with all the bells and whistles:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"github-mcp\": {\n      \"command\": \"gh-mcp-server\",\n      \"args\": [\"serve\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"GITHUB_TOKEN\": \"${GITHUB_TOKEN}\",\n        \"GITHUB_USERNAME\": \"${GITHUB_USERNAME}\",\n        \"GITHUB_REPO\": \"${GITHUB_REPO}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nLet's break down what each part does:\n- `mcpServers`: The root object containing all your MCP server configurations\n- `github-mcp`: A unique name for your GitHub MCP server instance\n- `command`: The command to run the GitHub MCP server\n- `args`: Additional arguments for the server\n- `env`: Environment variables for authentication and configuration\n\nPro tip: Store this in `.cursor/mcp.json` for project-specific settings, or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` for global access. And don't forget to add any files containing tokens to your `.gitignore`! Check out the [GitHub docs on securing your tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) for best practices.\n\n## Why Should You Care? 💡\n\nListen, I know what you're thinking - \"Another tool to learn? Come on!\" But this is different. This is GitHub we're talking about! They're not just playing in the AI sandbox; they're building the whole playground. With this MCP server, you get:\n\n1. Native VS Code support (smooth like butter!)\n2. Direct integration with GitHub's ecosystem\n3. A standardized way for AI to interact with your tools\n\n## The Future is Now 🔮\n\nThe coolest part? This is just the beginning. GitHub's MCP server is in public preview, which means it's gonna get even better. They're working with Anthropic (you know, the Claude people), and they're serious about making this the standard for AI tool interactions.\n\n## Getting Started 🚀\n\nWant to jump in? Here's what you need to do:\n\n1. Update your [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) to the latest version\n2. Create the `mcp.json` configuration (shown above)\n3. Set up your GitHub token in your environment\n4. Start coding with AI superpowers! \n\n## Pro Tips 💪\n\n- Keep your GitHub token secure (never commit it directly!)\n- Use environment variables for sensitive config\n- Start with the basic tools and expand as needed\n- Check out the [official MCP documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) for advanced configurations\n\nY'all, this is one of those moments where you can say \"I was there when...\" Trust me, GitHub's MCP server is about to change how we work with AI in development. It's like having a super-smart pair programmer who knows every tool in your belt!\n\nStay tuned for more updates, and don't forget to star the GitHub MCP Server repo! Catch you in the next one! ✌️\n\n## Further Reading 📚\n- [What is MCP?](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#what-is-mcp)\n- [MCP Architecture](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#architecture)\n- [Configuring MCP Servers](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#configuring-mcp-servers)\n- [Using MCP Tools in Agent](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#using-mcp-tools-in-agent)\n\n❤️❤️❤️","src/content/blog/github-mcp-server/index.mdx",[44],"eef338bb7a6c8978","how-i-salvaged-my-website-from-the-dead",{"id":272,"data":274,"body":283,"filePath":284,"assetImports":285,"digest":287,"deferredRender":22},{"title":275,"date":276,"path":277,"tags":278,"description":281,"heroImage":282,"published":22,"type":9},"Reviving My Website: A Tale of Tech and Determination",["Date","2023-10-28T00:00:00.000Z"],"/blog/how-i-saved-my-website-from-gatsby-screwup/",[53,279,280],"static site","web dev","I thought my website is gone and lost forever in the everchanging world of technology.

I'm back, and it's like I've been resurrected from the technological grave! You might have noticed my absence for a while. Well, let me tell you, it's been a rollercoaster ride in the realm of ones and zeros. I was juggling work and attempting to resuscitate my website, which seemed deader than a doornail in [the ever-evolving world of tech](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/vim-experience-nvim-dev-experience/). I donned my digital knight armor and embarked on a quest to save it from oblivion. Strap in and let's dive into this epic saga of revival.\n\n## The Techocalypse\n\nPicture this: One fateful day, out of nowhere, my trusty local setup for the website decided to throw in the towel. I was still rocking Gatsby v2 when Gatsby v3, 4, and 5 were partying. Meanwhile, Node.js had a whole coming-of-age journey, skyrocketing to v18 and 19, and npm decided to take the fast track to v7. My website's tech stack was stuck in a time warp, with Gatsby v2, Node v12, and npm v6. I was on the brink of a tech-nervous breakdown. Every build attempt greeted me with an error message that seemed to have its own cryptic language. I tried [to wrangle it into submission](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/gatsby-incremental-faster-builds-github-actions/), but it was like trying to teach a squirrel to ride a unicycle – frustrating and futile. My work was piling up, and I thought, \"I'll fix it later.\" Little did I know, that \"later\" would become a never-ending saga.\n\n### My Search Odyssey\n\nIf you peeked into my search history, you'd find the same error message searched more times than I've had cups of coffee. I was on the brink of losing my sanity, but a tiny spark of determination kept me going. I couldn't just abandon my website to [the digital abyss](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/computed-state-in-react); it had to rise from the ashes like a phoenix.\n\n##### Here are few snapshots of my search history:\nI was listening to [music](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged/) at the same time so you can see quite of music related history as well.

By fetching the ticket number from the JIRA REST API, developers can prefill the SCM commit input box with a commit message in the format (\u003CTicket number>) \u003CType>: , ensuring consistency and clarity across commit messages. Learn how you can build your own extension and simplify your Git workflows.",false,"Have you ever struggled with inconsistent Git commit messages in your organization's repositories? If so, you're not alone. I too found myself frustrated by this issue, and I went in search of a VS Code extension that could help enforce a standardized format for commit messages. Unfortunately, I was unable to find an extension that met my needs. So, I decided to build my own! \n\nIn this post, I'll share with you the story of how I built a custom VS Code extension in JavaScript to streamline Git workflows and ensure consistent commit messages. With this extension, developers can prefill the SCM commit input box with a commit message in the format `(\\\u003CTicket number\\>) \\\u003CType\\>: `, where the ticket number and type of commit are selected by the user. This format helps ensure consistency and clarity across commit messages based on your organization's [coding standards](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged).\n\n## The Problem\n\nInconsistent Git commit messages can be a major headache for developers and project managers alike. Without a standard format for commit messages, it can be difficult to track changes, understand the purpose of a commit, and identify which tickets or issues a commit is related to. In my own organization, we struggled with inconsistent commit messages across various repositories, and I knew there had to be a better way.\n\n## The Solution\n\nAfter searching for a VS Code extension that could help standardize our commit messages, I realized that I would need to build my own. Fortunately, creating a custom VS Code extension in JavaScript is relatively straightforward, especially if you are familiar with cutting-edge development experiences like [Neovim](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/vim-experience-nvim-dev-experience/).\n\nTo begin, I used the [VS Code Extension Generator](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension) to create a basic extension template. \n\nThe extension, written in JavaScript, adds a new command to VS Code called createCommitMessage. When the user executes this command, it prompts them to enter a ticket number and select a type of commit (such as \"feat\", \"fix\", or \"chore\"). It then constructs a commit message in the format (\\\u003CTicket number\\>) \\\u003CType\\>: , and pre-fills the Git commit input box with this message. The user can then add their own commit message and complete the commit as usual. It's as simple as creating [bookmarklets](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/bookmarklets/).\n\n## The Code\nThis is not the actual code, but something similar is used. You can check the repository for more details.\n\n```js\nfunction activate(context) {\n  let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('extension.createCommitMessage', function () {\n    vscode.window.showInputBox({\n      prompt: 'Enter the ticket number'\n    }).then(ticketNumber => {\n      if (!ticketNumber) return;\n      vscode.window.showQuickPick(['feat', 'fix', 'chore'], {\n        placeHolder: 'Select the type of commit'\n      }).then(type => {\n        if (!type) return;\n        const commitMessage = `(${ticketNumber}) ${type}: `;\n        const gitExtension = vscode.extensions.getExtension('vscode.git');\n        if (!gitExtension) {\n          vscode.window.showErrorMessage('Git extension not found');\n          return;\n        }\n        const api = gitExtension.exports.getAPI(1);\n        if (!api.repositories.length) {\n          vscode.window.showErrorMessage('No Git repository found');\n          return;\n        }\n        const repo = api.repositories[0];\n        repo.inputBox.value = commitMessage;\n      });\n    });\n  });\n  context.subscriptions.push(disposable);\n}\n```\n\nThis code defines an activate function that registers the createCommitMessage command. When the command is executed, it uses showInputBox and showQuickPick to prompt the user for input, constructs a commit message in the desired format, and sets the value property of the Git commit input box to the message. \n\nOverall, this extension provides a simple way to standardize commit messages across your organization and improve the consistency and clarity of your Git repositories. It's like having a [personalized coding standard](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged) for every commit message.","src/content/blog/i-built-a-vs-code-extension-to-standardize-git-commit-messages---here-s-how-you-can-too/index.mdx",[73],"2d0554d3b4880d7d","instagram-api/insta",{"id":304,"data":306,"body":313,"filePath":314,"assetImports":315,"digest":317,"deferredRender":22},{"title":307,"date":308,"path":309,"tags":310,"description":311,"heroImage":312,"published":22,"type":9},"How to post to Instagram using an API?",["Date","2022-07-10T00:00:00.000Z"],"/blog/instagram-api/",[113],"Did you know that you can post to instagram using an API?

I searched and looked for many ways and all of them seemed to be impossible. It is because Instagram doesn’t provide an API that can post images for you. After quite a few days of research, I came across a technique that would help us post to Instagram using an API – [The Instagram-Private-API](https://github.com/dilame/instagram-private-api).\n\n## Instagram Private API\n\nThe Instagram Private API is kind of like a back door to Instagram where you can manipulate and control Instagram as to how you would do in the real mobile application. You can like, comment, share, publish stories, or even send a DM using this API. This API is not very famous because your account could be at risk if you use this API.\n\nHere at [offshorewritings.com](https://offshorewritings.com), most of our social media interactions are automated. Thanks to Google’s [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer), [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) and [Zapier](https://zapier.com/). We have reduced the effort to publish to post our quotes and articles across various platforms. I’ve shared the code which can be used to login to Instagram and upload a photo for you through the API. There are also [examples](https://github.com/dilame/instagram-private-api/tree/master/examples) where you can post an image directly from a [web URL](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/gatsby-incremental-faster-builds-github-actions/).\n\n## The Code to post via API\n\nYou can use this code directly to post to Instagram from the API, just a couple of lines. Before using it make sure that you have the packages installed.\n\n```shell\nnpm install instagram-private-api\n```\n\nThen you can use the following code to post your pictures. Make sure, the pictures are in proper resolution and aspect ratio. Instagram supports the aspect ratio of `4:5` and `1.91:1`. If your images are not in this resolution, you might get an error.\n\n```js\nconst { IgApiClient } = require('instagram-private-api');\nconst { readFile } = require('fs');\nconst { promisify } = require('util');\nconst readFileAsync = promisify(readFile);\nconst ig = new IgApiClient();\n\n// Log in to your account\nconst auth = await ig.account.login('username', 'password');\n\n// Post the image\nconst publishResult = await ig.publish.photo({\n  file: await readFileAsync('path-to-image.jpg'),\n  caption: 'Hello World',\n});\n```\n\nIf you have any questions or queries, please let me know in the comments section.

You can still continue reading and get some insights. Okay, moving on, I've summarized my problematic workflow below.\n- Every time I want to commit, I have to remember the ticket ID that I'm working on.\n- Open the browser, go to JIRA, then search for the ticket.\n- Then copy the ID and use it in my commit message.\n- Format the commit message with brackets () and proper template\n\nThese steps were a blocker to my productivity and breaking my flow state.\n\n## Philosophy\n- Never leave your IDE for anything until the task is complete.\n- Get the ticket details to IDE and make life easier.\n- Streamline Git messages by segregating them into types:\n  - 🐞 Bug Fix\n  - ⏫ Updates\n  - 🔧 Optimization\n  - 🧹 Clean up\n  - 📋 Chore\n  - ⚪ Temp\n  - 📒 Documentation\n  - 🔂 Revert\n\nThis way, the commits are streamlined.\n\nIf you're interested in understanding more about state management in React, check out this [blog](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/state-management-using-usecontext).\n\n## Solution\nVS Code is the primary editor for most devs out there. I wanted to make this experience seamless. I'll show you how this extension was built.\n\n- The idea was to fetch the tickets assigned to you and list them as a quick-pick menu, from where you can select a ticket.\n- Then you will be provided with a list of options that specify the type of git commit.\n- Also, provide an option to manually enter the ticket ID in case the ticket is not listed in the quick-pick menu.\n\n##### There are a few things that are required for this to work:\n- JIRA API\n- JIRA Token\n- JIRA Username\n- JIRA JQL Query to fetch the tickets\n- A cache that will store tickets and reduce API Calls\n\n#### JIRA API\nThe REST API powers this extension. The URL begins something like `https://your-org.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/search`. This will enable us to fetch tickets from our organization's JIRA cloud.\n##### Authentication\nJIRA uses basic Authentication through an access token. The username is your email address, and the password is the access token.\n\n#### JIRA Token\nYou can create a token from [this page](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens) or read this [doc](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/). This token is required to access the resources. This token is shown only once, so keep it safely.\n\n#### JIRA Username\nThis is just your email that you use to log in. This serves as the username part of the Basic Auth. It should resemble samuel.lawrence@plivo.com.\n\n#### JQL Query\nWe are only going to show the last 15 tickets assigned to the current user. Older tickets might not be relevant. The JQL query that we use is this:\n\n```javascript\njql=updated >= -20d AND project = CNTO AND assignee in (currentUser()) order by updated DESC&maxResults=15\n```\n\n#### The Cache\nYes, hitting the API every time you summon the extension is not good. Graciously, VS Code provides a cache by default from its APIs. I've used it to store the tickets for 30 minutes, after which the API would be called again to fetch the fresh tickets.\n\nSample usage of the cache API _(actual code from the extension)_:\n\n```javascript\nlet issuesCache = new Cache(context);\n// Store Jira tickets in cache and set expiration to 30 mins in seconds\nawait issuesCache.put(CONSTANTS.storageKeys.tickets, jiraTickets, 1800);\n```\n\nIf you're interested in understanding more about handling side effects in React, check out this [blog](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/handling-side-effects-with-useeffect).\n\n### Recommended Workflow\nBefore executing this workflow, bind the command `JIRA Commit Helper: Create commit message` command to a key chord like Cmd + G, Cmd + M _(Git + Message)_.\nAfter this, committing becomes very easy.\n- You stage all the required files.\n- Press Cmd + G, Cmd + C.\n- Select the JIRA ID from the populated list.\n- Select the commit type.\n- Type a short commit message.\n- Commit.\n\nLife becomes much simpler.\n\nSurely give this extension a try. It will simplify your workflow and streamline your commits. Suggest this to your team, and if everybody starts using this, the commit messages will look so elegant, so beautiful, just looking like a wowww.\n\n### Recommending the extension to your team\nYou can add this to workspace recommendations in your source code and it will be recommended for all the members of your team.\n```json\n// .vscode/extensions.json\n{\n  \"recommendations\": [\n      \"samuellawrentz.jira-git-commit-helper\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nDo give a [5-star rating](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SamuelLawrentz.jira-git-commit-helper&ssr=false#review-details) for the extension.

Discover how Gemini Pro & ChatGPT, powerful AI tools, can help you quickly analyze, navigate, and comprehend complex software projects.","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./ai_code.jpeg","Are you staring down a massive code repository, feeling overwhelmed by its complexity? You're not alone. Diving into unfamiliar codebases can be a daunting task, but luckily, we're in an era where artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the game. Let's explore how Gemini Pro, a cutting-edge AI model, can become your code comprehension sidekick.\n\n![AI Codebase](./ai_codebase.jpg)\n\n**The Challenge of Code Comprehension**\n\nLarge software projects often evolve into intricate webs of files, functions, and classes. For newcomers and even seasoned developers, understanding the underlying structure, dependencies, and purpose of each element can be a major hurdle. Manual analysis can be painfully slow, error-prone, and simply frustrating. \n\n**Enter Gemini Pro: Your AI-Powered Code Navigator**\n\nGemini Pro is a language model developed to handle vast amounts of text – an impressive 2 million tokens, to be precise! This immense capacity makes it the perfect tool to analyze an entire code repository in one go. By feeding your repository into Gemini Pro, you unlock a powerful ally that can answer your most pressing questions about the code.\n\n**How to Leverage Gemini Pro for Codebase Mastery**\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to harness the power of Gemini Pro:\n\n1. **Create a Unified Source Dump:**\n   - Use a simple script to combine all the code files in your repository into a single text file. Here's an example bash script to get you started:\n\n ```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Directory of the repository (default to current directory if not specified)\nREPO_DIR=\"${1:-.}\"\n\n# Output file\nOUTPUT_FILE=\"combined_code_dump.txt\"\n\n# List of file extensions to include\nFILE_EXTENSIONS=(\"tsx\" \"ts\")  # Add more extensions as needed\n\n# Empty the output file if it exists\n> \"$OUTPUT_FILE\"\n\n# Function to combine files\ncombine_files() {\n  local dir=\"$1\"\n  for ext in \"${FILE_EXTENSIONS[@]}\"; do\n    find \"$dir\" -type f -name \"*.$ext\" -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' file; do\n      echo \"// File: $file\" >> \"$OUTPUT_FILE\"\n      cat \"$file\" >> \"$OUTPUT_FILE\"\n      echo -e \"\\n\\n\" >> \"$OUTPUT_FILE\"\n    done\n  done\n}\n\n# Combine the files\ncombine_files \"$REPO_DIR\"\n\necho \"All code files have been combined into $OUTPUT_FILE\"\n```\n\n2. **Feed the Dump to Gemini Pro:**\n   - Upload your `source_dump.txt` file to the Gemini Pro environment. There are various ways to integrate with Gemini Pro, so explore the documentation for the best approach for your setup.\n\n3. **Ask the Right Questions:**\n   - Gemini Pro's understanding of your codebase is only as good as the questions you ask. Here are some powerful prompts to kickstart your exploration:\n\n   - \"What is the overall architecture of this project?\"\n   - \"Summarize the main functions and classes in this repository.\"\n   - \"How does module X interact with module Y?\"\n   - \"Identify potential bottlenecks or areas for optimization.\"\n   - \"Generate a flowchart illustrating the main code paths.\"\n\n**Key Benefits of the Gemini Pro Approach**\n\n* **Speed:**  Save countless hours compared to manual code review.\n* **Accuracy:** Reduce the risk of misunderstandings or overlooking crucial details.\n* **Insight:** Gain a high-level overview and drill down into specific areas effortlessly.\n* **Collaboration:** Share insights easily with your team.\n* **Continuous Learning:** Adapt to code changes by updating the source dump and re-querying Gemini Pro.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n* **Privacy:** If your codebase is sensitive, ensure you're using a secure environment for interacting with Gemini Pro.\n* **Complexity:**  Extremely large or highly complex repositories might require breaking them down into more manageable chunks for optimal analysis.\n\n**Keywords for Search Engine Optimization**\n\ncode comprehension, code analysis, AI-powered development, Gemini Pro, language models, codebase navigation, software development tools, code repository analysis\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDon't let complex codebases intimidate you.

It's the new kid on the block._ But what exactly is BunJS? It's a lightning-fast bundler for JavaScript applications, built on top of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). Think of it as Kevin Hart on a caffeine high - quick, energetic, and ready to take your app to the next level. You can learn more about such fast developing experiences [boosted using using vim](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/vim-experience-nvim-dev-experience/).\n\n**Speed... Faster Than a Barista's Espresso Machine**\n\nThe first thing that caught my attention was the incredible speed of the build process. With BunJS, my app compiles faster than it takes me to make a cup of coffee (and I'm talking about those fancy, Instagram-worthy latte art cups). Seriously, it's like having Usain Bolt sprinting through your code. Plus, the hot module replacement feature is so quick that I barely have time to switch tabs before my changes are reflected. It's like having a team of speedy little minions updating your app in the blink of an eye. You can learn more about [fast builds](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/gatsby-incremental-faster-builds-github-actions/).\n\n**Simplicity... No More Configuration Confusion**\n\nBut speed isn't the only advantage. BunJS also brings a simplified and intuitive configuration setup. No more digging through endless configuration files; with BunJS, it's all about simplicity, just like Kevin Hart's stand-up comedy. Just import your components, write your code, and let BunJS take care of the rest. It's like having a personal assistant who anticipates your needs and handles the boring stuff, so you can focus on the fun and creative aspects of coding. Learn more about state [computation in React here](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/computed-state-in-react).\n\n**Migrating Made Easy... Like a Smooth Kevin Hart Transitions in Comedy Shows**\n\nMigrating to BunJS was surprisingly smooth. I just followed the [official migration guide](https://bunjs.com/docs/migration-guide) and made a few small tweaks here and there - not as many tweaks as Kevin Hart does on stage, though. The transition was a breeze, thanks to the excellent documentation and helpful community. It's like having a whole troupe of comedy experts guiding you through the process, making sure you land every punchline. You can learn more about [coding standards](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged) here.\n\n**Conclusion... The Comedy of Development with BunJS and Vite**\n\nIn conclusion, BunJS and Vite have completely changed the way I develop JavaScript applications - in the best way possible, of course. The speed, simplicity, and seamless migration process have made me wonder how I ever managed without them. It's like discovering a brand new Kevin Hart comedy special and realizing it's even funnier than the last one. So, if you're tired of waiting for your code to compile and want a more delightful and exciting development experience, give BunJS a try. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!

Click to read more.","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./css-grid.png","For a long time, I was against the use of modern CSS properties and tools. This was because the organization that I used to work for supports older versions of [Internet Explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_version_history#:~:text=The%20first%20version%20of%20Internet,other%20companies%20initiating%20browser%20development.). So Flexbox and Grid were out of the equation. It was just `position` `display` `float` `clear` `text-align` `vertical-align` properties that I was using for positioning.\n\nLater when I moved to a new organization, there were no such restrictions. All I had to do was make the web pages load faster and look good on all devices and browsers. Then I took interest in `flexbox`. I almost use all the flex properties regularly and they are stored in my mind as a fresh copy. This shift in my work environment was akin to my experience when I moved from [Vim to Neovim](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/vim-experience-nvim-dev-experience/).\n\nEven when I was working with flexbox, I always looked up to CSS Grids as something awesome. Every time I try to learn/read and understand it, I would get bored or screw up my understanding. But now, after eons, I guess I've finally cracked up the mystery behind CSS Grids.\n\nRecently, I played a game that has like 80 levels in it, which progressively teaches you about CSS grids. It took me 3 days to complete all the levels. I played it during my leisure time, it was fun. Thanks to the creator. You can give it a try, it's interesting. This game reminded me of the [time I used Gatsby and GitHub Actions to create faster builds](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/gatsby-incremental-faster-builds-github-actions/).\n\n> Play it here - [Coding fantasy - CSS Grid game](https://codingfantasy.com/games/css-grid-attack)\n\n## Do we need media queries? I guess not.\nThere are functions in CSS!! Yes, you heard me - functions! What if I told you that you are already using them!? Yes, `rgb()`, `rgba()`, `hsl()`, `calc()`, etc all these are CSS functions. Grids introduce few new functions to use `repeat()`and `minmax()`. This concept of functions in CSS is no different from the time I learned about [Computed State in React](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/computed-state-in-react).\n\n### WTH is `minmax()`?\nWith `minmax()` we can avoid writing media queries and breakpoints. All you have to do is define a minimum width and a maximum width for your grid cells. The rest would be taken care of by CSS.\n\n`minmax(minimum-value, max-value)`\nThe values can be any of these `px`, `%`, `fr`, `min-content`, `max-content`.  Alright, we have talked a lot about CSS and grids. Let's see some code.\n\n## Tile layout\nPreviously, tile layout was difficult and we had to write a bunch of CSS code. Now with grid, it has become a breeze. I use the CSS grid for my [blog listing page](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/). Do check it out! You might also want to check out [this article on Coding Standards with TypeScript and Husky](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged).\n\n```css\n.grid {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-gap: 15px;\n  // auto-fit takes care of the number of columns it can fit into\n  // the given space\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));\n  grid-auto-rows: 200px;\n  grid-auto-flow: dense;\n}\n```\n## Breaking down into bits\nOkay, let me break down the above style into some readable components\n - `display: grid`\n\tObviously, This is required.\n - `grid-gap:15px`\n\tThis is used to define a gap between the grid cells. Forget about margins. If it is a grid, we use `gap` or `grid-gap`\n - `grid-template-columns`\n\tThis is used to define the blueprint of the grid columns - describes how many columns and the width of each column.\n - `repeat()` \n As mentioned earlier, this is a CSS function, that repeats whatever is passed as a 2nd argument for the number of times passed in the 1st argument.\n - `auto-fit` \n Calculates the number of columns that need to be generated based on the specified width.\n - `minmax()`\n This also is a CSS function, we've already covered it above.\n - `grid-auto-rows`\n This property defines a standard height for the rows so that you don't have to specify explicit heights.\n - `grid-auto-flow`\n This property is used to specify the algorithm that is used to fill the grid. By default it is `row`. `dense` fills the gap with smaller items wherever possible. This makes the grid look dense.\n\nI've shared my thoughts and understanding. Feedbacks are valuable.

Growing your online presence should be your key focus.","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./online.png","In this modern world, the world where everything is digital from currency to emotions, an online presence is very important. Previously, just owning a website/blog meant that you have a strong online presence, but now, in this age of internet, there is just more to that. Just google your name or the name of your product/company. How many relevant results pop up? Also, how many social media profiles do you maintain? These factors and your [coding standards](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged) all contribute to your online presence.\n\n## What is Online Presence?\nOn the internet, how far has your name reached? How many users can recognize your brand? Companies like [Facebook](https://facebook.com), [Amazon](https://amazon.com), [Google](https://google.com), are at the zenith of digital marketing. Almost everyone who uses the internet knows these names. That’s called Online Presence. This presence can be enhanced with strategies such as [incremental builds](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/gatsby-incremental-faster-builds-github-actions/).\n\n## Things that increase your Online Presence\n- **Blogging** – This helps in generating content related to your product or niche. As more people read and share your content, your fingerprint on the internet grows. Blogs about [coding experiences](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/vim-experience-nvim-dev-experience/) or [computed state in react](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/computed-state-in-react) can help in this regard.\n- **Social Media** – There are numerous social media platforms out there. Make sure that you are active on at least 4 of them. I would recommend – Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest. Sharing content like [bookmarklets](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/bookmarklets/) can increase your reach.\n- **Search Engine Optimisation** – Also known as SEO. This plays a key role in bringing organic traffic to your site. Optimize your site/blog so that Google can understand the content and bring people to you. This time you don’t spread the word, the search engines spread.\n- **Analytics** – This doesn’t directly impact your online presence but keeping tabs of who your visitors are and what they want can greatly benefit you. A good example would be [monitoring website pagespeed with googlesheets](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/monitor-website-pagespeed-with-googlesheets/).\n- **Ads** – More than half of the internet survives through Advertisements. Yes, they can cost you but they are worth the money.\n- **Content is the king** – People are attracted to what gives value to them. They don’t come to you because you sell a product. They come to you because they want it. So your content/product should be the key to all of these. Give people what they want, and your name will spread throughout.\n\n## Okay, but How?\nYes, you have only 2 hands, 2 eyes, and 1 brain and 24 hours. How can you do all these in parallel? That’s where automation comes into play. Now businesses have understood the importance of online presence and have come up with automation tools for almost every task that you can even think of. Tools like [Zapier](https://zapier.com), [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/), [Buffer](https://buffer.com), etc they take these burdens from you so that you can focus on the content.\n\nKeep posting more content on your blog and share them across social media platforms. Keep everything in sync so that you don’t have to post on each platform separately. Also, consistency is the key, people as well as google crawlers like consistency. So whatever you do, keep it consistent. Utilizing tools like a [Jira git commit workflow vscode extension](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/jira-git-commit-workflow-vscode-extension/) can help streamline this process.\n\n## To conclude\nOnline presence is not something that can be brought from a shop. It takes time to harvest. You need to be patient. There are many shortcuts, but most of them won’t work properly. They seem to look like it is working, but it won’t. Just be true and patient and consistent, you will reap the fruits later. Remember, understanding concepts like [conditional rendering with and operator](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/conditional-rendering-with-and-operator) and [mapping arrays to JSX elements](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/mapping-arrays-to-jsx-elements) can go a long way in improving your online presence.","src/content/blog/online-presence/index.mdx",[406],"./online.png","24868a427367657d","random-array/2022-06-27",{"id":408,"data":410,"body":417,"filePath":418,"assetImports":419,"digest":421,"deferredRender":22},{"title":411,"date":412,"path":413,"tags":414,"description":415,"heroImage":416,"published":22,"type":9},"How to Select a Random Value from an Array?",["Date","2022-06-27T00:00:00.000Z"],"/blog/random-value/",[18],"Sometimes you have a list of values to choose from and you want to randomize it?

It can be easily done with a line of code. This approach can be used in any programming language. Since I'm kinda comfortable with Javascript I've used JS code here. Please feel free to let me know your feedback and suggestions in the comments section. This article will help us understand how to select a random value from an array of values. Also if you are interested in React, check this post about [arrays and react elements](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/mapping-arrays-to-jsx-elements).\n\nGetting a random number is easy. You just need to call Math.random() and it will produce a random decimal between 0 and 1 (exclusive). You just need to multiply it with the upper limit of your choice.\n\n## How to use `Math.random()` and select a random value from an array?\n\nThe idea is simple, we just get a random index between 0 and array's length and pick a value using that index. But the catch here is that Math.random() gives us a decimal with greater precision so we floor the random number to an integer. [Understanding arrow functions in event handlers](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/understanding-arrow-functions-in-event-handlers) can also be handy in this case.\n\nThe idea is simple, we just get a random index between 0 and array's length and pick a value using that index. But the catch here is that Math.random() gives us a decimal with greater precision so we floor the random number to an integer.\n\nConsider this code snippet,\n```js\nconst arr = ['apple', 'orange', 'pineapple', 'banana', 'grapes'];\n\n// The code for picking a random value from an array is quite simple\nconst randomValue = arr[Math.floor(Math. random() * arr.length)];\n```\nBreaking the code\n\n**`Math.floor()`** – Returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.\n\n**`Math.random()`** – Returns a decimal between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).\n\n**`Math.floor(Math. random() * arr.length)`** – Return a random number between 0 and arr.length -1 (because Math.floor is used). We then use this random number as an index for picking an element from the array.\n\n### Working Example\nHere is a working CodePen to select a random value from an array. You can click the button to obtain a random value.\n\n\u003Ciframe\n  height=\"300\"\n  style=\"width: 100%;\"\n  scrolling=\"no\"\n  title=\"Random Array Value\"\n  src=\"https://codepen.io/yLevMwd/embed/yLevMwd?default-tab=result\"\n  frameborder=\"no\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  allowtransparency=\"true\"\n  allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n>\n  See the Pen on \u003Ca href=\"https://codepen.io/pen/yLevMwd\">CodePen\u003C/a>.\n\u003C/iframe>\n\n## Pro tip:\nIf you want a value to be repeated often or you wanted to give more weight to a particular value, repeat that value two or more times in the array. For example, if you want more `apple` returned while getting random values, use `apple` twice or thrice.\n\n```js\nconst arr = ['apple', 'apple', 'apple', 'orange', 'pineapple', 'banana', 'grapes'];\n```\n\nIn this way, you will get more apples returned than other values.

This post teaches you how you can create a simple hook timer using React. Click to read more.","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./react-hooks.jpg","I love React, and so do you! The Javascript ecosystem has grown so much that now we have amazing frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte (Sorry Vue!), and amazing tools like Vite, Webpack, Rollup, and many more. Nowadays it's mostly declarative coding than the old imperative style we used to follow [a while back](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged).\n## Hooks\nHooks are nothing but a Javascript function where you can move your repetitive logic in React. If you understand the beauty of Hooks, you would find yourself writing [clean React code](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged). Hooks were introduced in React v17, since then it is driving the developers crazy.\n\nAlmost all developers use React Hooks in their daily code. A few of the famous and popular hooks are `useState`, and `useEffect`. You are not a React developer if you have not used [these things](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/setting-initial-state-with-usestate). Gone are the days of class-based components. Now everything has become functional.\n\n\u003Caside class=\"banner banner-info\">Hooks allow you to use other hooks inside it - this is the main difference between a Javascript function and a [React Hook](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/how-to-use-computed-state-in-react).\u003C/aside>\n\n## Creating a React Hook\nThere is only one rule that you have to follow to create a react hook -\nThe function must start with \"use\". This will allow React to understand the function is a hook and it doesn't treat it as a normal function.\n### Creating a simple timer in React using Hooks\nOkay, let us create a simple hook that can be used as a timer. You can follow this tutorial for [creating a timer with hooks](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/handling-array-state-updates-immutably).\n\n```js\n// hook.js\n\nimport {useState, useEffect} from 'react'\n\nexport const useTimer = () => {\n\tconst [tick, setTick] = useState(0)\n\tconst date = new Date(0)\n\tdate.setSeconds(tick)\n\t// This converts seconds to mm:ss format\n\tconst timeString = date.toISOString().substr(14, 5);\n\n\t// Runs only on init\n\tuseEffect(() => {\n\t    const interval = setInterval(() => setTick(t => t+1), 1000)\n\t    return () => clearInterval(interval)\n  });\n\n\t// Return the timer string finally\n\treturn timeString\n}\n```\n\nThen you can use it in your component like this in a simple way.\n\n```jsx\nexport const Timer = () => {\n\t// As simple as that\n\tconst timeString = useTimer()\n\treturn \u003Cdiv>{timeString}\u003C/div>\n}\n```\n\nHow cool is that? The state logic has been moved into the hook and you don't have to worry about anything else. Thus Hooks can be used to separate UI logic from business logic. You can learn more about [handling form inputs](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/handling-form-inputs-usestate) with hooks.\n\nI've created the sample code for you to try in the Codesandbox.

A complete guide from setup to troubleshooting, perfect for developers who want to supercharge their error tracking with AI capabilities.","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./sentry.png","Welcome, developers! If you're looking to streamline your error tracking workflow by connecting Cursor IDE with Sentry, you're in the right place. In this guide, we'll walk through setting up a connection between these tools using MCP (Model Context Protocol).\n\n## What's this MCP thing anyway? 🤔\n\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol designed to establish secure bidirectional connections between AI-powered development tools and various data sources. In the context of Sentry integration, MCP creates a standardized communication layer that allows Cursor's AI features to directly interact with your error tracking and performance monitoring data, enabling real-time analysis and intelligent querying capabilities.\n\n## Prerequisites (The Boring-but-Important Stuff)\n\nBefore we dive in, let's make sure you've got all your ducks in a row:\n\n1. **Cursor IDE** - You've got this installed, right? RIGHT?\n2. **Python & pipx** - Because we're fancy like that\n\n```bash\n# Install pipx if you haven't already\npython -m pip install --user pipx\npython -m pipx ensurepath\n\n# Verify installation\npipx --version\n```\n\n3. **Sentry Account** - You'll need one of those sweet, sweet auth tokens\n\n## The Main Event: Setting Up Sentry MCP 🎪\n\n### Step 1: Grab Your Auth Token\n\n1. Head over to [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io)\n2. Navigate to Settings > Auth Tokens\n3. Create a new token (give it the permissions it needs to be useful)\n\n### Step 2: Fire Up the MCP Server - Test Run\n\n```bash\npipx run mcp-server-sentry --auth-token YOUR_TOKEN\n```\n\nReplace `YOUR_TOKEN` with your actual token. And please, for the love of all things holy, don't commit this token to Git! 🙈\n\n### Step 3: Configure Cursor\n\n1. Open Cursor Settings (the gear icon, you know the drill)\n2. Find Features > MCP\n3. Click \"+ Add New MCP Server\"\n4. Fill in these details:\n   - Transport Type: `command`\n   - Name: \"Sentry\" (or \"Error-Be-Gone\" if you're feeling creative)\n   - Command: The command from Step 2\n\n## Testing Your Connection 🧪\n\nIf everything's working, you should be able to:\n- See Sentry in your MCP server list\n- Query error events\n- Track performance metrics\n- Feel like a 10x developer\n\nTry these cool prompts in Cursor:\n```\n\"Show me production errors from last hour\"\n\"List unresolved issues affecting most users\"\n\"Get performance metrics for the auth service\"\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting (When Things Go South) 🔧\n\nIf your connection is acting like a moody teenager:\n\n1. Check your auth token (is it valid?)\n2. Verify pipx installation (`pipx --version`)\n3. Look for error messages in Cursor's MCP logs\n4. Make sure your network isn't blocking the connection\n\n## Pro Tips 🎯\n\n1. Keep your token secure (seriously, don't share it!)\n2. Use minimal permissions\n3. Regular health checks are your friend\n4. Update your MCP server package regularly\n\n## Wrapping Up 🎁\n\nThere you have it! You've just leveled up your error tracking game. Now your Cursor IDE can chat directly with Sentry, making debugging feel less like a wild goose chase and more like a guided tour.\n\nRemember: With great power comes great responsibility. Use your new MCP superpowers wisely!\n\nHappy coding! 🚀\n\n---\n\nP.S. If this helped you avoid at least one production fire, consider sharing it with your team.

Learn how scroll-behavior and scroll-margin-top properties create seamless, professional scrolling experiences that users love.","Have you ever clicked an anchor link on a website and been jarred by the sudden, instant jump to another section? That abrupt movement can feel harsh and disorienting. Fortunately, there's a simple CSS solution that can make your website feel more polished and professional with just two lines of code.\n\n## The Problem with Default Scrolling\n\nBy default, when users click internal links or when JavaScript programmatically scrolls to elements, the browser instantly jumps to the target location. While functional, this behavior can feel jarring and break the smooth flow of user interaction.\n\n## The Solution: Smooth Scrolling CSS\n\nThe code snippet shown demonstrates two powerful CSS properties that work together to create a seamless scrolling experience:\n\n```css\nhtml {\n  scroll-behavior: smooth;\n}\n\n[id] {\n  scroll-margin-top: 60px;\n}\n```\n\nLet's break down what each property does:\n\n### `scroll-behavior: smooth`\n\nThis property applied to the `html` element enables smooth scrolling for the entire page. Instead of instant jumps, the browser will animate the scroll transition, creating a gentle gliding effect when:\n- Users click anchor links (`\u003Ca href=\"#section\">`)\n- JavaScript calls [`scrollIntoView()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView) or similar methods\n- The browser navigates to URL fragments (like `yoursite.com#about`)\n\nLearn more about the [`scroll-behavior` property on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-behavior).\n\n### `scroll-margin-top: 60px`\n\nThis property is applied to all elements with an `id` attribute (`[id]`). It adds invisible margin space above the target element when scrolling to it. This is incredibly useful for:\n- **Fixed headers**: Prevents content from being hidden behind sticky navigation bars\n- **Visual breathing room**: Ensures the target content isn't flush against the top of the viewport\n- **Better readability**: Gives users context by showing some content above the target\n\nRead the complete documentation for [`scroll-margin-top` on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-margin-top).\n\n## Why This Matters for User Experience\n\nThese two simple lines of CSS can significantly improve how users interact with your website:\n\n1. **Professional feel**: Smooth animations make your site feel more polished\n2. **Better navigation**: Users can follow the scroll movement and understand where they're going\n3. **Reduced cognitive load**: Smooth transitions are less jarring than instant jumps\n4. **Accessibility**: Some users with [vestibular disorders](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/animation-from-interactions.html) prefer reduced motion, but smooth scrolling is generally more comfortable than sudden movements\n\nFor more insights on web accessibility, check out the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/).\n\n## Browser Support and Considerations\n\nThe `scroll-behavior` property has excellent modern browser support, working in all current versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. For older browsers, it gracefully degrades to the default instant scrolling behavior.\n\nCheck the latest [browser support for scroll-behavior on Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/css-scroll-behavior).\n\nThe `scroll-margin-top` property is also well-supported and provides a much cleaner solution than the old technique of using invisible padding or positioning hacks. View [scroll-margin browser support](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_scroll-margin-top).\n\n## Implementation Tips\n\n- **Adjust the margin**: The `60px` value should match your fixed header height\n- **Consider mobile**: You might need different values for different screen sizes using [CSS media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)\n- **Test thoroughly**: Make sure your smooth scrolling doesn't interfere with other animations\n- **Respect user preferences**: Consider using [`prefers-reduced-motion`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion) media query for users who prefer less animation\n\nHere's an example of respecting user motion preferences:\n\n```css\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {\n  html {\n    scroll-behavior: smooth;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nLearn more about [creating inclusive animations](https://web.dev/prefers-reduced-motion/) on web.dev.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSometimes the most impactful improvements come from the simplest solutions. These two lines of CSS demonstrate how small details can make a big difference in user experience. Smooth scrolling might seem like a minor enhancement, but it's these thoughtful touches that separate good websites from great ones.\n\nFor more CSS tips and tricks, explore the [CSS-Tricks website](https://css-tricks.com/) or dive deeper into [modern CSS techniques on web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/css/).\n\nNext time you're building a website with internal navigation, remember this simple technique.

Discover the guiding principles shaping the work of world-class software engineers. Dive deep into the essence of coding principles and software philosophy. #softwaredevelopment #codingprinciples","\"As a software engineer, your skill is in more demand than ever before, but it’s up to you to keep it sharp.\" - Robert C. Martin\n\nIn the realm of software development, certain principles guide us. Here are the Ten Commandments of Software Development:\n\n1. **Write Simple Code:** Concentrate on making your code simple and understandable. As [Martin Fowler](https://refactoring.com/) puts it, \"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.\"\n\n2. **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system. More on this can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).\n\n3. **Keep It Short and Sweet (KISS):** Avoid unnecessary complexity. If it can be done in a simpler way, do it.\n\n4. **Make It Work, Then Make It Better:** Don't aim for perfection from the start. Build a prototype, then iterate and improve.\n\n5. **Test Your Code:** Always write tests for your code. It ensures reliability and can save you from potential bugs.\n\n6. **Stay Updated:** Technology evolves rapidly. Keep learning and stay updated with the latest technology trends.\n\n7. **Collaborate:** Software development is a team sport. Learn to work effectively with others.\n\n8. **Think about the User:** Your software is meant to solve problems for its users. Always keep them in mind.\n\n9. **Continuous Improvement:** Strive to improve your codebase and your skills constantly.\n\n10. **Have Fun:** Enjoy the process. If you love what you do, you'll do great work.\n\n> \"Programming isn't about what you know; it's about what you can figure out.\" - Chris Pine\n\nThese commandments are not set in stone, but they provide a solid foundation for any software engineer. Keep them in mind, and they will undoubtedly lead you to produce better software.\n\n---","src/content/blog/ten-commandments/index.mdx",[44],"0c2a896a2a0c90a6","useful-css-generators",{"id":516,"data":518,"body":525,"filePath":526,"assetImports":527,"digest":529,"deferredRender":22},{"title":519,"date":520,"path":521,"tags":522,"description":523,"heroImage":524,"published":22,"type":9},"Useful CSS Generators",["Date","2022-11-18T00:00:00.000Z"],"/blog/useful-amazing-css-tools-and-generators",[459],"CSS is awesome, these tools take your CSS to the next level. They ease your load and generate CSS code for you online. Try out these Generators.","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./CSS.png","CSS has evolved greatly in recent years. A lot of things can be done using CSS alone. This not only improves performance it also makes the life of the developer easier instead of writing a lot of Javascript code. Also, a great variety of things can be done with CSS. For more insights into advanced coding, you can also check out this [blog about coding standards](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged).\n\nI have gathered a list of CSS generators from various sources which could be helpful. Let me know in the comments if you’ve used any of these tools or if you've tried any other cool [coding hacks](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/how-to-use-computed-state-in-react). Okay, let's go!\n\n## 1. Stripes Generator\n    \nYou can generate any kind of stripe background using this generator. This might come in handy when you have some complex stripe to be created just like creating [dynamic JSX elements](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/mapping-arrays-to-jsx-elements).\n\n[https://stripesgenerator.com/](https://stripesgenerator.com/)\n\n![Stripes Generator](./1.png \"Stripes Generator\")\n\n## 2. Gradient Generator\n    \nDo you have some cool gradient mix in mind? And you want to convert it to CSS code. This tool will help you. Also, you can check out this [guide on handling form inputs](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/handling-form-inputs-usestate) if you plan to implement a form on your website.\n\n[https://cssgradient.io/](https://cssgradient.io/)\n\n![Gradient Generator](./2.png \"Gradient Generator\")\n\n## 3. Pattern Generator\n    \nThis tool generates a pattern and provides you with the base64 code for it. You can even add a different color for each box you select. Try it now. If you're also interested in handling array state updates, this [guide](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/handling-array-state-updates-immutably) might be helpful.\n\n[http://www.patternify.com/](http://www.patternify.com/)\n\n![Pattern Generator](./3.png \"Pattern Generator\")\n\n## 4.  Accordion/Collapse generator\n    \nIf you are a web dev surely you would have come across creating an accordion. We would have searched some UI library or some snippet that we had to modify based on our needs. That job is tedious and hence this tool exists. For more development tips, this [blog about Jira git commit workflow](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/jira-git-commit-workflow-vscode-extension/) might be of interest.\n\nCreate accordions just by moving some sliders. - [https://accordionslider.com/](https://accordionslider.com/)\n\n![Accordion/Collapse generator](./4.png \"Accordion/Collapse generator\")\n\n## 5. Layout Generator\n    \nI’m sure you would have spent a good amount of time trying to laying out things properly. And even if we did, we would forget the responsive aspect of the layout. This tool helps you create layouts with ease. You might also find this [guide on React's useContext hook](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/state-management-using-usecontext) useful for managing state in your layout.\n\n[https://grid.layoutit.com/](https://grid.layoutit.com/)\n\n![Layout Generator](./5.png \" Layout Generator\")\n\n## 6. Animations and CSS helper tools\n    \nThis tool helps you create animations based on steps. You just have to define how the element should look at each step and it generates the heavy CSS for you. They also have some additional cool tools to generate shadows and colors. If you're into React, this [blog on useEffect hook](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/handling-side-effects-with-useeffect) might be of interest.\n\n[https://keyframes.app/animate](https://keyframes.app/animate)\n\n![Animations and CSS helper tools](./5.png \"Animations and CSS helper tools\")\n\nThat's it for today.

Well, grab your popcorn because we're about to dive into something that's about to flip the script on everything you know about coding. Let me introduce you to your new best friend: Vibe Coding! 🎉\n\n## What in the World is Vibe Coding? \n\nPicture this: You're sitting there, sipping your fifth coffee of the day, and instead of wrestling with semicolons and brackets, you're just... vibing with your AI coding assistant. That's right, we're talking about coding with the same energy as explaining to your friend what you want for lunch. \"Yo, I need a React component that shows user profiles with some sweet animations\" - and BOOM! Your AI buddy's got your back.\n\n## Why It's Not Just Another Tech Buzzword\n\nListen, I know what you're thinking. \"Oh great, another trendy tech term that'll disappear faster than my weekend plans.\" But hold up! This is different, and here's why:\n\n### 1. It's Like Having a Senior Dev in Your Pocket\n- No more Stack Overflow rabbit holes\n- Instant code suggestions that actually make sense\n- Documentation that doesn't make you want to cry\n\n### 2. Productivity Goes Through the Roof\nRemember spending hours debugging that one function? With vibe coding, you're like:\n\"Hey AI, this function is acting weird\" \nAnd it's like:\n\"Say less fam, let me fix that for you\" \n\n### 3. The Learning Curve? Smoother Than Your Morning Coffee\n\nInstead of:\n```javascript\nconst implementFeature = () => {\n  // *Stares at screen for 3 hours*\n  // *Questions career choices*\n  // *Googles \"how to center a div\" for the 100th time*\n}\n```\n\nYou get:\n```javascript\n// Just tell your AI:\n\"Create a responsive grid layout with card components\"\n// And watch the magic happen!\n```\n\n## But Keep It Real Though\n\nNow, before you start thinking this is some magical solution that's gonna make all developers obsolete, pump those brakes! Vibe coding is like having a super-smart assistant - it helps you work faster and smarter, but you still need to know your stuff. It's like having autocorrect for coding, but you better know what you're trying to say in the first place!\n\n## The Future is Looking Extra Spicy 🌶️\n\nHere's what's coming:\n- AI that understands your coding style better than your work spouse\n- Faster prototyping than your product manager can say \"sprint planning\"\n- Code reviews that don't make you want to change careers\n\n## Real Talk: The Practical Side\n\nLet's break down what vibe coding actually looks like in your day-to-day:\n\n1. **Project Setup**: Instead of spending hours configuring webpack, you just describe your dream setup\n2. **Feature Implementation**: Focus on the what, let AI handle the how\n3. **Bug Fixing**: AI analyzes your code faster than you can say \"it works on my machine\"\n4. **Code Reviews**: Get instant feedback that's actually helpful\n\n## The Tools of the Trade\n\nYour vibe coding toolkit might include:\n- GitHub Copilot (Your personal code whisperer)\n- ChatGPT (For those deep coding conversations)\n- Claude (When you need that extra brain power)\n- And whatever new hotness drops next week (because let's be real, tech moves FAST)\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nVibe coding isn't just changing how we write code - it's revolutionizing the whole game. It's making coding more accessible, more efficient, and dare I say... more fun? (Did I just say coding could be fun? Yes, yes I did!)\n\nSo whether you're a seasoned dev who remembers debugging with print statements (respect ✊), or you're just starting out and wondering what all the fuss is about, vibe coding is about to become your new favorite thing since dark mode.\n\nRemember folks: The future of coding isn't about knowing every syntax by heart - it's about vibing with AI to create something awesome. Now go forth and vibe code your way to glory! 🚀\n\n## Quick Tips for Getting Started\n\n1. Start small - Use AI for simple tasks first\n2. Learn to communicate clearly with AI\n3. Always review the generated code\n4. Keep learning the fundamentals\n5. Share your experiences with other developers\n\n## The Last Word\n\nLook, at the end of the day, vibe coding is like having a conversation with a really smart friend who happens to know everything about coding. It's not about replacing developers - it's about making us all better at what we do.\n\nAnd remember: If your code works on the first try, please contact NASA. They're looking for miracles like you. 😉\n\n---\n\n*Keep coding, keep vibing, and most importantly, keep learning!* 🎯\n\nP.S. If you enjoyed this post, share it with your developer friends. They might be stuck in a debugging session right now and could use a good laugh (and some hope for the future).","src/content/blog/vibe-coding-revolution/index.mdx",[542],"./header-new.png","357b5a69d4e104d2","vim-lsp-hover-borders",{"id":544,"data":546,"body":555,"filePath":556,"assetImports":557,"digest":558,"deferredRender":22},{"title":547,"date":548,"path":549,"tags":550,"description":554,"heroImage":40,"published":22,"type":9},"How to Enable Borders on Vim LSP Hover Information (The Simple Way)",["Date","2025-08-15T00:00:00.000Z"],"/blog/vim-lsp-hover-borders/",[551,552,553],"vim","lsp","configuration","Struggling with borderless LSP hover popups in Vim?

But there's just one tiny thing driving you absolutely bonkers: **those hover popups have no borders**.\n\nI know, I know. It's such a small detail, but when you're staring at code for hours (fueled by ungodly amounts of coffee, naturally), those borderless popups just... they blend into everything. It's like trying to read a ghost's diary written in invisible ink.\n\n## The Great Border Hunt Begins\n\nSo there I was, 2 AM on a Tuesday (because when else do we solve these problems?), frantically Googling variations of \"vim lsp hover border\", \"neovim popup border\", and my personal favorite: \"why does my vim hate aesthetic boundaries.\" \n\nI dove deep into plugin documentation, thinking surely I need some fancy border plugin. Maybe `popup.nvim`? Or perhaps some custom LSP configuration that requires seventeen different settings and a blood sacrifice to the Vim gods? I was ready to install whatever it took.\n\n**Spoiler alert**: I was overthinking it. By approximately 847%.\n\n## The Plot Twist (AKA The Solution)\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity of rabbit holes and coffee-induced documentation reading, I stumbled upon the solution. Turns out there are actually **two approaches** that work beautifully, and both are surprisingly simple.\n\n**Method 1: Global Window Borders**\n```lua\nvim.o.winborder = 'rounded'\n```\n\n**Method 2: LSP-Specific Hover Configuration**\n```lua\n-- In your keybinding configuration\n{ \"K\", function() vim.lsp.buf.hover { border = \"single\", max_height = 25, max_width = 120 } end, desc = \"Hover documentation\" }\n```\n\nThat's it! No plugins required, no complex setup wizardry. Just a couple of configuration options and boom – you've got gorgeous borders on your LSP hover information.\n\n![screenshot of the hover](./ss.png)\n\n## How It Actually Works\n\nHere's the thing that makes this so elegant: Neovim's built-in popup system already has border support. It was just sitting there, waiting for us to ask nicely.\n\n**Method 1** (`vim.o.winborder`) sets a global border style for all floating windows in your Neovim session. This affects not just LSP hover information, but also completion menus, diagnostic popups, and other floating windows.\n\n**Method 2** gives you granular control over LSP hover specifically. You can customize the border style, maximum height, and width just for hover documentation. This approach lets you keep different border styles for different types of popups if you're feeling fancy.\n\nYou have several border style options:\n- `rounded` - Nice rounded corners (classic choice)\n- `single` - Clean single-line border  \n- `double` - Double-line border for that retro terminal vibe\n- `solid` - Solid block characters\n- `none` - No border (but why would you want that?)\n\nThe LSP-specific approach also lets you control popup dimensions with `max_height` and `max_width` parameters, which is super handy for those monster documentation strings that want to take over your entire screen.\n\n## The Complete Setup\n\n**Option 1: Global Window Borders (Simplest)**\n\nAdd this to your `init.lua`:\n\n```lua\n-- Set borders for all floating windows\nvim.o.winborder = 'rounded'\n```\n\n**Option 2: LSP-Specific Configuration (More Control)**\n\nIf you're using which-key or custom keybindings, you can configure the hover function directly:\n\n```lua\n-- In your keybinding setup (like which-key configuration)\n{ \"K\", function() \n    vim.lsp.buf.hover { \n      border = \"single\", \n      max_height = 25, \n      max_width = 120 \n    } \n  end, \n  desc = \"Hover documentation\" \n}\n```\n\nOr if you prefer a more traditional keymap:\n\n```lua\nvim.keymap.set('n', 'K', function()\n  vim.lsp.buf.hover { border = \"single\", max_height = 25, max_width = 120 }\nend, { desc = \"Hover documentation\" })\n```\n\nThat's it. Restart your editor, hover over a function, and marvel at those beautiful borders. It's like putting glasses on for the first time – suddenly everything just looks... better.\n\n## Why This Matters More Than You Think\n\nLook, I get it. Borders on popup windows might seem like a trivial cosmetic thing. But here's why it actually matters:\n\n**Visual Separation**: When you're working with complex codebases, clear visual boundaries help your brain process information faster. Those borders create a clear distinction between the hover information and your actual code.\n\n**Reduced Eye Strain**: Borderless popups can blend into your background, forcing your eyes to work harder to focus on the content. With borders, your brain instantly knows where to look.\n\n**Professional Polish**: If you're sharing your screen during code reviews or pair programming sessions, those clean borders make your setup look intentional and professional.\n\n## The Learning Moment\n\nThe real lesson here isn't about borders – it's about not overcomplicating solutions. I spent hours researching plugins and complex configurations when the answer was literally one line of built-in functionality.\n\nThis reminds me of my experience with [coding standards and tooling](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged/) – sometimes the best solutions are the simplest ones hiding in plain sight.\n\n## Beyond Just Borders\n\nOnce you've got your borders sorted, you might want to explore other LSP customizations. The popup system in modern Vim is surprisingly flexible. You can customize colors, positioning, and even add custom keybindings for navigating hover information.\n\nIf you're interested in more Vim productivity tips, check out my other posts about [development workflow optimization](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/jira-git-commit-workflow-vscode-extension/) and how small configuration changes can have huge impacts on your daily coding experience.\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\nSometimes the best discoveries are the simplest ones. One line of configuration, and suddenly your LSP hover information goes from \"meh\" to \"oh, that's so much better!\"\n\nNext time you find yourself going down a rabbit hole for what seems like a complex problem, take a step back. Check the built-in options first. You might be surprised at what's already there, just waiting for you to ask nicely.\n\nNow go forth and enjoy your beautifully bordered hover information. Your eyes (and your late-night coding sessions) will thank you.\n\nHappy coding! 🎉","src/content/blog/vim-lsp-hover-borders/index.mdx",[44],"c526cdebe32dfacf","vim-is-a-blackhole",{"id":559,"data":561,"body":570,"filePath":571,"assetImports":572,"digest":574,"deferredRender":22},{"title":562,"date":563,"path":564,"tags":565,"description":568,"heroImage":569,"published":22,"type":9},"Vim is a blackhole",["Date","2023-04-28T00:00:00.000Z"],"/blog/vim-experience-nvim-dev-experience",[297,551,566,567],"nvim","IDE","I suddenly got pulled into the blackhole called VIM.

What if I told you there are computed variables in react and they could help you to reduce the number of state variables you use?","React is reactive because of its reactive state variables and props. What if I told you, you don't need as many state variables as you require? If you've used VueJs or KnockoutJS you might know about `computed` variables. In react, most of the reactive states could be converted into computeds' without involving a state variable.\n## Computed variables in React?\nWhat is a computed variable? Computed variable is nothing but a value which is derived from or computed from a state variable. The value of this variable changes when there is a change in the state variable that it is dependent upon.\n\n### Use of a computed variable\nComputed variables can replace your extra state variables and help you reduce your re-renders. It also reduces your `useEffect` hooks that you would require to update these values.\n\n### How to convert state variable to a computed value?\nConsider this example where you have to show a error message based on the input value. You could see yourself writing two state variables. One for `value` and the other for the `error` state. The following code illustrates it.\n\n```jsx\n//bad\nconst [value, setValue] = useState()\nconst [error, setError] = useState() // this is not required as a state\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n  if (value === '') setError('Value cannot be empty')\n}, [value])\n\nreturn (\n  \u003Cdiv>\n    \u003Cinput value={value} onChange={({ target }) => setValue(target.value)} />\n    {error && \u003Cdiv className=\"error-msg\">{error}\u003C/div>}\n  \u003C/div>\n)\n\n```\nActually you could keep the `error` as a normal variable which would be computed during each render based on the value of the `value` state.\n\nThis would be the better approach ✅\n```jsx\n//good\nconst [value, setValue] = useState()\n// here error is a computed value\nconst error = value === '' ? 'Value cannot be empty' : ''\n\nreturn (\n  \u003Cdiv>\n    \u003Cinput value={value} onChange={({ target }) => setValue(target.value)} />\n    {error && \u003Cdiv className=\"error-msg\">{error}\u003C/div>}\n  \u003C/div>\n)\n\n```\n Thus we have eliminated a state variable and an unwanted useEffect hook. Mission accomplished. Likewise, in your daily work, identify which state variables are computed values and replace them with normal variables. Your app could become a lot faster.\n \n⚡️⚡️⚡️","src/content/blog/you-don-t-need-these-many-state-variables/index.mdx",[44],"769e09c0853a876d","hacks",["Map",589,590,603,604,614,615,625,626,636,637,647,648,658,659,668,669,678,679,688,689,699,700,712,713,723,724,734,735,744,745,756,757,766,767,777,778,788,789,799,800,812,813,822,823,833,834,844,845,855,856,867,868,880,881,893,894,904,905,916,917,929,930,942,943,954,955,966,967,977,978,988,989,1001,1002,1013,1014,1025,1026,1037,1038,1049,1050,1060,1061,1071,1072,1084,1085,1096,1097,1106,1107,1116,1117,1128,1129,1140,1141,1151,1152,1163,1164,1173,1174,1185,1186,1196,1197,1207,1208,1219,1220,1231,1232,1242,1243,1253,1254,1264,1265,1275,1276,1287,1288,1298,1299,1309,1310,1320,1321,1331,1332,1343,1344,1355,1356,1366,1367,1376,1377,1389,1390,1399,1400,1410,1411,1420,1421,1431,1432,1443,1444,1453,1454,1464,1465,1475,1476,1487,1488,1498,1499,1510,1511,1520,1521,1530,1531,1541,1542,1552,1553,1565,1566,1577,1578],"microfrontend/cross-team-collaboration-microfrontend-communication-tricks",{"id":589,"data":591,"body":600,"filePath":601,"digest":602,"deferredRender":22},{"title":592,"path":593,"description":594,"type":595,"tags":596,"published":22},"Cross-Team Collaboration - MicroFrontend Communication Tricks","/hacks/microfrontend/cross-team-collaboration-with-microfrontend","Learn key hacks for effective cross-team collaboration using Micro Frontend architecture.

In this blog post, we explore some essential tips and tricks to get the most out of Neovim and boost your coding efficiency.\n\n### 1. Master Key Mappings\n\nCustom key mappings can drastically speed up your workflow. Neovim allows you to remap keys to suit your preferences. Here’s an example of how to set custom key mappings in your `init.vim` file:\n\n```vim\n\" Remap leader key to space\nlet mapleader=\" \"\n\n\" Save file with leader + s\nnnoremap \u003Cleader>s :w\u003CCR>\n\n\" Quit Neovim with leader + q\nnnoremap \u003Cleader>q :q\u003CCR>\n```\n\nBy customizing your key mappings, you can execute frequent commands faster, reducing the time spent on repetitive tasks.\n\n### 2. Utilize Neovim Plugins\n\nPlugins can significantly enhance Neovim’s functionality. Here are a few must-have plugins:\n\n- **[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)**: A minimalist plugin manager.\n- **[coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)**: Intellisense engine for fast, smart completion.\n- **[nerdtree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree)**: File system explorer for navigation.\n\nTo install these plugins, add the following to your `init.vim`:\n\n```vim\n\" Plug plugin manager\ncall plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')\n\n\" List of plugins\nPlug 'junegunn/vim-plug'\nPlug 'neoclide/coc.nvim', {'branch': 'release'}\nPlug 'preservim/nerdtree'\n\n\" Initialize plugin system\ncall plug#end()\n```\n\n### 3. Optimize Startup Time\n\nA slow startup can hinder productivity. To speed up Neovim's startup time, consider lazy loading plugins. For example, you can load `NERDTree` only when it's needed:\n\n```vim\nPlug 'preservim/nerdtree', { 'on': 'NERDTreeToggle' }\n```\n\nThis prevents the plugin from loading at startup, reducing the time Neovim takes to initialize.\n\n### 4. Customize Status Line\n\nA well-customized status line can provide critical information at a glance. `lightline.vim` is a popular choice for this:\n\n```vim\nPlug 'itchyny/lightline.vim'\n\n\" Customize lightline\nlet g:lightline = {\n      \\ 'colorscheme': 'wombat',\n      \\ 'active': {\n      \\   'left': [ [ 'mode', 'paste' ],\n      \\             [ 'gitbranch', 'readonly', 'filename', 'modified' ] ]\n      \\ },\n      \\ 'component_function': {\n      \\   'gitbranch': 'FugitiveHead'\n      \\ },\n      \\ }\n```\n\n### 5. Leverage Built-in LSP\n\nNeovim’s built-in Language Server Protocol (LSP) support provides IDE-like features. To configure LSP, use the `nvim-lspconfig` plugin:\n\n```vim\nPlug 'neovim/nvim-lspconfig'\n\nlua \u003C\u003C EOF\nrequire'lspconfig'.pyright.setup{}\nEOF\n```\n\nThis configuration sets up LSP for Python using `pyright`.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNeovim’s flexibility and efficiency can be unlocked with these tips and tricks. By mastering key mappings, utilizing plugins, optimizing startup time, customizing the status line, and leveraging built-in LSP, you can significantly boost your coding efficiency.\n\nReady to transform your coding experience?

One such tool is Neovim, a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. Understanding the core concepts of Neovim, specifically buffers, windows, and tabs, is crucial to unleashing its true potential. So let’s dive in!\n\n## Buffers in Neovim\nA buffer is a file loaded into memory for editing. All opened files are associated with a buffer, and there can be multiple or no windows displaying a buffer.\n\n```vim\n:ls \" Lists the buffers\n:bnext \" Go to the next buffer\n:bprev \" Go to the previous buffer\n:bd \" Delete a buffer (close a file)\n```\n\n## Windows in Neovim\nA window is a viewport on a buffer. You can have multiple windows on a single buffer or a single window on multiple buffers.\n\n```vim\n:split \" Splits the window horizontally\n:vsplit \" Splits the window vertically\n:close \" Closes the current window\n```\n\n## Tabs in Neovim\nA tab page is a collection of windows. You can use tabs to group related windows together. Each tab can contain multiple windows, each window viewing a single buffer.\n\n```vim\n:tabnew \" Creates a new tab\n:tabnext \" Goes to the next tab\n:tabprev \" Goes to the previous tab\n:tabclose \" Closes the current tab\n```\n\n## Practical Workflow\nLet’s consider a practical workflow to understand how these concepts come together. Suppose you are editing a JavaScript file and an associated CSS file.\n\n```vim\n:e index.js \" Edit a JavaScript file\n:vsplit styles.css \" Open the CSS file in a new vertical window\n:tabnew about.js \" Open another JavaScript file in a new tab\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n> \"Understanding is the first step to control.\" - Terry Goodkind. \n\nNeovim's philosophy truly aligns with this quote. By understanding the concepts of buffers, windows, and tabs, you can navigate the Neovim environment more efficiently, enhancing your productivity as a software engineer. \n\nConsider this blog post as your stepping-stone towards mastering Neovim. Keep experimenting with different workflows and find the one that suits your needs the best.\n\nFor more information, the official Neovim documentation is a comprehensive guide that covers these concepts in depth.

We understand this and have a useful hack to ameliorate this issue. \n\n![ESLint diagnostics](./lsp.png)\n\nThe ESLint LSP server is a fantastic tool for identifying potential bugs and syntax errors while ensuring code quality. However, the bombardment of warnings marking every tiny deviation from the rules can be more of a disturbance than a help, disrupting your focus and stealing valuable code time.\n\nWe present a simple, nuanced solution – a way to toggle these warnings on and off at will, putting you in the driving seat of your Neovim experience. Let's walk you through the implementation using Lua programming language:\n\n```lua\n-- Disable ESLint LSP server and hide virtual text in Neovim\n-- Add this to your init.lua or init.vim file\nlocal isLspDiagnosticsVisible = true\nvim.keymap.set(\"n\", \"\u003Cleader>lx\", function()\n    isLspDiagnosticsVisible = not isLspDiagnosticsVisible\n    vim.diagnostic.config({\n        virtual_text = isLspDiagnosticsVisible,\n        underline = isLspDiagnosticsVisible\n    }) end)\n```\n\n\nIn this script, we created a local variable `isLspDiagnosticsVisible` to keep track of the visibility of LSP diagnostics. With the straightforward command `\u003Cleader>lx` in Neovim, you can switch the visibility of the ESLint LSP server's underlined warning text and virtual text on and off. \n\nThis hack allows you to continue to harness the power of the ESLint LSP server without the annoyance of continuously highlighted errors. You can decide when you want to view these diagnostics, providing a cleaner workspace, and fostering a less stressful coding environment. \n\nSo go ahead, increase your productivity by customizing your Neovim experience with this meaningful hack.\n\n## References\n1.

This concept, closely linked with the Agile methodology, encourages us to embrace the inevitability of failure in the pursuit of creating better software.\n\nThe idea is simple - rather than spending an excessive amount of time in the planning phase, you begin working on your software project, knowing well that your first attempts may not be perfect. This is the \"Fail Fast\" part. The sooner we can identify and confront the issues in our software, the faster we can learn from them and make necessary improvements. This is the \"Learn Faster\" part.\n\nOne of the key elements of this philosophy is [Iteration](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum). An iterative approach to software development allows us to break down large, complex projects into manageable chunks. We then work on these smaller parts in short, iterative cycles, continuously testing and improving our work as we go along. \n\nA famous quote by John 'maddog' Hall, the executive director of Linux International, encapsulates this philosophy perfectly - \n> “We all learn by making mistakes. The sooner we make a mistake, the faster we can correct it. If we are not making mistakes, we are not trying new things.”\n\nThis is the beauty of the \"Fail Fast, Learn Faster\" philosophy. It doesn't shy away from failure but rather embraces it as a critical part of the learning process. In a rapidly evolving field like software development, this approach can lead to constant evolution and improvement, keeping us ahead in this competitive landscape.\n\nTo read more about software development philosophies and methodologies, check [atlassian's agile guide articles](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/software-development).\n\nSo, let’s embrace the art of iteration, fail fast, learn faster, and create superior software!","src/content/hacks/philosophy/fail-fast-learn-faster-the-art-of-iteration-in-software/index.mdx","98ca3b814ad65986","philosophy/simplicity-over-complexity-the-essence-of-minimalism-in-software-design",{"id":880,"data":882,"body":890,"filePath":891,"digest":892,"deferredRender":22},{"title":883,"path":884,"description":885,"type":595,"tags":886,"published":22},"Mastering Minimalism in Software Design - Simplicity Over Complexity","/hacks/philosophy/mastering-minimalism-in-software-design-simplicity-over-complexity","Explore the essence of minimalism in software design, emphasizing simplicity over complexity.

This principle, an essential part of minimalistic software design, advocates for maintaining the simplicity of code, reducing cognitive load for developers, and enhancing maintainability.\n\nConsider an example:\n\n```javascript\n// Complex code\nfunction calculateSalary(employee) {\n    if(employee.type === 'fulltime') {\n        return employee.hoursWorked * employee.hourlyRate;\n    } else if(employee.type === 'parttime') {\n        return employee.hoursWorked * employee.hourlyRate * 0.5;\n    }\n}\n\n// Simplified code\nfunction calculateSalary(employee) {\n    let rate = employee.type === 'fulltime' ? 1 : 0.5;\n    return employee.hoursWorked * employee.hourlyRate * rate;\n}\n```\n\nThe simplified code is easier to understand, maintain, and less prone to errors. This embodies the concept of simplicity over complexity. \n\nMinimalism in software design is not just about writing less code. It's also about [creating simpler architecture](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/vim-experience-nvim-dev-experience/), [increasing build speeds](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/gatsby-incremental-faster-builds-github-actions/), and [using computed state in React](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/computed-state-in-react), among others. \n\nFollowing [coding standards](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged) and [utilizing bookmarklets](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/bookmarklets/) can help maintain simplicity. Monitoring [website pagespeed](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/monitor-website-pagespeed-with-googlesheets/) and using [Jira git commit workflow](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/jira-git-commit-workflow-vscode-extension/) can also contribute to a minimalist approach.\n\n_\"Simplicity is the soul of efficiency.\"_ - Austin Freeman\n\nIn conclusion, simplicity over complexity is a philosophy that encourages minimalism in software design, making software systems more maintainable, efficient, and reliable. \n\nEmbrace simplicity.

This approach, often referred to as User-Centric Software Development, emphasizes the importance of making user needs the focal point of software design and implementation.\n\n```javascript\nfunction userNeeds() {\n  return \"User needs are paramount for software development\";\n}\n```\nIn essence, it's about ensuring the software meets the needs, expectations, and preferences of the end-user. This involves a deep understanding of who your users are, what they need, and how they interact with your software.\n\nThis philosophy can be integrated into different stages of software development. From the initial design process, through coding standards, to the final testing stage. \n\n[Samuel Lawrentz](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged) provides an excellent guide on how to maintain coding standards in TypeScript, which is a vital part of user-centric software development.\n\n```typescript\nconst codingStandard = () => {\n  return \"Coding standards are crucial in user-centric software development\";\n}\n```\n\nFamed computer scientist Donald Knuth once said, \"The User is always right.\" This mantra encapsulates the spirit of User-Centric Software Development. By putting users at the heart of your software, you create a product that is not only functional but also user-friendly, reliable, and efficient.\n\nThe user-centric approach also requires developers to keep improving and adapting their software based on user feedback and needs. A guide to using [computed state in React](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/computed-state-in-react) can be handy in this respect, as it allows developers to make their software more responsive and user-friendly.\n\n```react\nconst UserFeedback = ({feedback}) => {\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv>\n      {feedback.map((item) => (\n        \u003Cp>{item}\u003C/p>\n      ))}\n    \u003C/div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn conclusion, User-Centric Software Development is a philosophy that prioritizes the needs and expectations of users. It is a powerful approach that can significantly improve the quality and functionality of your software.\n\nAs the great Steve Jobs once said, \"You've got to start with the customer experience and work back toward the technology - not the other way around.\" This encapsulates the essence of User-Centric Software Development, making it an essential philosophy for all software developers to grasp and apply.","src/content/hacks/philosophy/putting-users-first-a-guide-to-user-centric-software-development/index.mdx","a7e113769b9da337","philosophy/prioritizing-security-a-fundamental-tenet-of-software-philosophy",{"id":904,"data":906,"body":913,"filePath":914,"digest":915,"deferredRender":22},{"title":907,"path":908,"description":909,"type":595,"tags":910,"published":22},"Prioritizing Security - A Fundamental Tenet of Software Philosophy","/hacks/philosophy/prioritizing-security-fundamental-tenet","Explore the importance of prioritizing security in software development philosophy, its implications, and practical approaches to incorporate it into your code.",[509,911,912],"security","code","\"Security is not an add-on, but a fundamental part of software. It's not a feature; it's a necessity.\" - Bruce Schneier\n\nIn the modern era of software development, prioritizing security is not just an option; it's a necessity. It is one of the key tenets of software philosophy, underlining the fact that the safety of user data and system integrity cannot be compromised at any cost.\n\n## Prioritizing Security in Your Code\n\nWhen it comes to implementing security in your code, it is not just about using security tools or libraries but about making it an integral part of your development process. Here's a basic example of how you can incorporate security checks in your code:\n\n```javascript\nfunction authenticateUser(username, password) {\n  if (!username || !password) {\n    throw new Error('Username or password missing');\n  }\n\n  // Add more security checks here...\n}\n```\n\nThis code snippet ensures that both username and password are provided before proceeding further, acting as a basic yet crucial security check.\n\n## Security as a Philosophy\n\nSecurity is not a one-time task, but a continuous process. It should be ingrained in every phase of software development - from planning and designing to coding, testing, and maintenance.\n\nRemember, security is not an afterthought. It is a fundamental tenet of software philosophy that must be prioritized right from the start. As [Samuel Lawrentz](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged) rightly mentions in his post, adhering to coding standards is a good starting point in this journey.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEmbracing security as a part of your software philosophy is not just about preventing potential threats or vulnerabilities.

From data privacy to AI, the challenges we face require a nuanced understanding of ethics. This blog post explores these dilemmas through a philosophical lens, offering insights into their implications and guiding frameworks for decision-making.\n\n## Data Privacy: Balancing Convenience and Security\n\nData privacy is one of the most pressing ethical issues today. With the rise of big data and AI, organizations collect vast amounts of personal information. While this data can improve services, it also raises concerns about privacy and security. Philosophically, this dilemma can be framed through the lens of utilitarianism and deontology.\n\n### Utilitarian Perspective\n\nUtilitarianism, which advocates for the greatest good for the greatest number, might justify data collection if it leads to societal benefits. However, this perspective often overlooks individual rights.\n\n### Deontological Perspective\n\nConversely, deontology emphasizes the importance of individual rights and duties. From this viewpoint, unauthorized data collection is inherently unethical, regardless of the potential benefits.\n\n## Artificial Intelligence: The Ethics of Automation\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) presents another significant ethical dilemma. While AI can enhance efficiency and innovation, it also poses risks such as job displacement and biased algorithms.\n\n### Quotes to Consider\n\n- \"The end does not justify the means.\" — Immanuel Kant\n- \"The greatest happiness of the greatest number is the foundation of morals and legislation.\" — Jeremy Bentham\n\n## Ethical Frameworks for AI\n\nWhen addressing AI ethics, two primary frameworks come into play: consequentialism and virtue ethics.\n\n### Consequentialism\n\nConsequentialism evaluates the moral worth of an action based on its outcomes. In the context of AI, this would involve assessing the overall societal impact, such as job creation versus job loss.\n\n### Virtue Ethics\n\nVirtue ethics focuses on the moral character of individuals making decisions. This framework emphasizes the importance of ethical behavior and integrity in AI development and deployment.\n\n## Environmental Ethics: Sustainability and Responsibility\n\nEnvironmental ethics is another crucial area where modern dilemmas arise. Climate change, pollution, and resource depletion challenge us to rethink our relationship with nature.\n\n### Internal Links\n\nFor more on this topic, check out our [guide to sustainable living](https://www.example.com/sustainable-living-guide).\n\n## Philosophical Approaches\n\n### Deep Ecology\n\nDeep ecology advocates for a fundamental shift in how we perceive our relationship with the environment, emphasizing intrinsic value and interconnectedness.\n\n### Anthropocentrism\n\nAnthropocentrism, on the other hand, places human needs and interests at the center of ethical consideration, often justifying environmental exploitation.\n\n## Conclusion: Navigating Ethical Dilemmas\n\nNavigating ethical dilemmas requires a balanced approach, drawing on various philosophical perspectives. Whether dealing with data privacy, AI, or environmental issues, understanding these frameworks can help us make informed and ethical decisions.\n\n## Call to Action\n\nStay informed and make ethical choices.

Unveil the timeless wisdom of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle that shapes contemporary thought.",[936,937,938],"ancient-philosophy","modern-thinking","philosophy-impact","## The Foundations of Ancient Philosophy\n\nAncient philosophy, particularly from Greek thinkers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, has profoundly influenced modern thinking. Their ideas laid the groundwork for contemporary thought in various fields, including ethics, politics, and science. \n\n### Socratic Method and Critical Thinking\n\nSocrates introduced the **Socratic Method**, a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue. This technique is still used today in law schools and intellectual discussions to stimulate critical thinking and illuminate ideas. The method involves asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and draw out underlying presuppositions.\n\n```python\n# An example of a Socratic questioning model in Python\ndef socratic_method(question):\n    answers = {\n        \"What is justice?\": \"Justice is fairness.\",\n        \"What is truth?\": \"Truth is coherence with reality.\"\n    }\n    return answers.get(question, \"Let's delve deeper into that question.\")\n    \nprint(socratic_method(\"What is justice?\"))\n```\n\n### Platonic Ideals and Modern Ethics\n\nPlato's theory of **Forms** or **Ideals** suggests that the material world is a shadow of a higher reality. This concept has influenced modern metaphysics and ethics, proposing that there are absolute truths and ideals we should strive for. Plato's works continue to be a cornerstone in discussions about morality and the nature of reality.\n\n> \"The object of knowledge is what exists and its function to know about reality.\" - Plato\n\n### Aristotelian Logic and Scientific Method\n\nAristotle's work in logic and the **scientific method** has been foundational for modern science and philosophy. His **syllogistic logic** forms the basis of deductive reasoning, a critical aspect of scientific inquiry and rational argumentation.\n\n```javascript\n// Example of Aristotelian logic in JavaScript\nfunction syllogism(premise1, premise2) {\n    if (premise1 === \"All humans are mortal\" && premise2 === \"Socrates is a human\") {\n        return \"Socrates is mortal\";\n    }\n    return \"Invalid syllogism\";\n}\n\nconsole.log(syllogism(\"All humans are mortal\", \"Socrates is a human\"));\n```\n\n### Stoicism and Modern Psychology\n\nThe Stoics, like Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, emphasized personal ethics informed by a system of logic and natural law. Stoicism's principles of resilience and emotional control have found a place in modern psychology, particularly in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).\n\n> \"The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.\" - Marcus Aurelius\n\n## The Enduring Legacy\n\nThe impact of ancient philosophy is evident in modern educational curricula, ethical debates, and scientific methodologies. By understanding these ancient philosophies, we gain a deeper appreciation of the principles guiding modern thought and can apply these timeless lessons to contemporary challenges.\n\n### Call-to-Action\n\nDive deeper into the fascinating world of ancient philosophy and its modern implications.

The `handleClick` function triggers a focus on this input when the button is clicked.\n\nRemember, `useRef` does not notify you when its content changes. Mutating the `.current` property won't cause a re-render.

One key aspect is to optimize the loading time of your application's JavaScript. This is where code splitting comes into play. In this post, we'll discuss code splitting strategies in React, providing a guide to optimize your web applications.\n\n## What is Code Splitting?\n\nCode splitting is a technique that allows you to split your code into various bundles which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel. This can significantly improve the performance of your application and is considered a best practice in web development.\n\n## Code Splitting in React\n\nReact allows you to use code splitting via the `React.lazy()` and `Suspense` features. \n\n```javascript\nimport React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';\n\nconst SomeComponent = lazy(() => import('./SomeComponent'));\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv>\n      \u003CSuspense fallback={\u003Cdiv>Loading...\u003C/div>}>\n        \u003CSomeComponent />\n      \u003C/Suspense>\n    \u003C/div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Strategies for Code Splitting in React\n\n1. **Route-based code splitting**: This is the most common strategy used. It involves splitting your code based on the routes of your application. This means that the code for each route is separate and only loaded when the user navigates to that route.\n\n2. **Component-level code splitting**: This strategy involves splitting your code at the component level. This can be useful if you have large components that are not always needed.\n\n3. **Library-level code splitting**: This strategy involves splitting your code at the library level. This can be useful if you have large libraries that are not always needed.\n\nBy using these strategies, you can split your code into smaller, more manageable chunks, improving the performance of your application. For more information, you can refer to [React's documentation on code splitting](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html).\n\nRemember, \"The key to performance is elegance, not battalions of special cases.\" - Jon Bentley\n\n[Further Reading on React Performance](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/monitor-website-pagespeed-with-googlesheets/)\n\n[How to Use Computed State in React](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/how-to-use-computed-state-in-react)\n\n[Understanding Arrow Functions in Event Handlers](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/understanding-arrow-functions-in-event-handlers)","src/content/hacks/react/code-splitting-strategies-in-react/index.mdx","305b448e99272206","react/building-seamless-user-interfaces-with-react-a-step-by-step-tutorial",{"id":1001,"data":1003,"body":1010,"filePath":1011,"digest":1012,"deferredRender":22},{"title":1004,"path":1005,"description":1006,"type":595,"tags":1007,"published":22},"Building Seamless User Interfaces with React: A Step-by-Step Tutorial","/hacks/react/building-seamless-user-interfaces","Learn how to build seamless user interfaces with React in this step-by-step tutorial. Optimize your web applications for performance and user experience by mastering React components and state management.",[82,1008,1009],"web-development","user-interface","## Introduction\n\nBuilding seamless user interfaces (UIs) is crucial for creating engaging and functional web applications. React, a popular JavaScript library, simplifies this process with its component-based architecture. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the steps to create a seamless UI using React.\n\n## Setting Up Your React Environment\n\nBefore diving into code, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Create a new React application using the Create React App tool:\n\n```bash\nnpx create-react-app seamless-ui\ncd seamless-ui\nnpm start\n```\n\nYour development server should be running at `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n## Creating Components\n\nReact components are the building blocks of your UI. Let's start by creating a `Header` component. Create a new file `Header.js` in the `src` directory:\n\n```jsx\n// src/Header.js\nimport React from 'react';\n\nfunction Header() {\n  return (\n    \u003Cheader>\n      \u003Ch1>Welcome to My App\u003C/h1>\n    \u003C/header>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Header;\n```\n\nNext, import and use the `Header` component in `App.js`:\n\n```jsx\n// src/App.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Header from './Header';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv className=\"App\">\n      \u003CHeader />\n    \u003C/div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\n## Managing State\n\nState management is essential for interactive UIs. React’s `useState` hook makes it easy to manage state in functional components. Let's add a counter to our app:\n\n```jsx\n// src/Counter.js\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv>\n      \u003Cp>Current count: {count}\u003C/p>\n      \u003Cbutton onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment\u003C/button>\n    \u003C/div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Counter;\n```\n\nInclude the `Counter` component in `App.js`:\n\n```jsx\n// src/App.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Header from './Header';\nimport Counter from './Counter';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv className=\"App\">\n      \u003CHeader />\n      \u003CCounter />\n    \u003C/div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\n## Styling Your Components\n\nTo make your UI visually appealing, add CSS styles. Create a `styles.css` file in the `src` directory:\n\n```css\n/* src/styles.css */\nheader {\n  background-color: #282c34;\n  padding: 20px;\n  color: white;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n\nbutton {\n  padding: 10px 20px;\n  font-size: 16px;\n  margin-top: 10px;\n}\n```\n\nImport the styles in `App.js`:\n\n```jsx\n// src/App.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport './styles.css';\nimport Header from './Header';\nimport Counter from './Counter';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv className=\"App\">\n      \u003CHeader />\n      \u003CCounter />\n    \u003C/div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCongratulations! You've built a seamless user interface with React. By mastering component creation, state management, and styling, you can develop engaging and high-performance web applications.\n\n> \"The best interfaces are almost invisible to the user.\" - Jakob Nielsen\n\n### Call to Action\n\nReady to take your React skills to the next level?

It's important to remember one constraint - direct manipulation of state is forbidden in React. You can learn more about this concept in this [blog post on computed state in React](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/computed-state-in-react).\n\nSuppose, we have an existing state:\n\n```javascript\nthis.state = {\n  firstName: 'John',\n  lastName: 'Doe'\n};\n```\n\nTo compute a value based on this state, you would create a function that will be executed within the render method. You can refer to this [blog post on coding standards with TypeScript](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged) to understand better coding practices.\n\n```javascript\nfullName() {\n  return `${this.state.firstName} ${this.state.lastName}`;\n}\n```\n\nThen call this function in your render method:\n\n```javascript\nrender() {\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv>\n      \u003Ch2>{this.fullName()}\u003C/h2>\n    \u003C/div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nNow, the full name is dynamically calculated and will update as soon as either its first or last name changes. This [article on conditional rendering with the AND operator](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/conditional-rendering-with-and-operator) can give further insights on dynamic rendering in React.\n\nThe use of computed state can significantly decrease complexity in your code by avoiding storing redundant data and ensuring that your data is always consistent. Remember that improperly handling computed state may result in inconsistency and subtle bugs in your application. You can refer to this [blog post on using useEffect for lifecycle events](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/use-effect-for-lifecycle-events) to understand how to handle state changes efficiently.\n\n## References\n1.

Welcome to the open source world.`;\n}\n```\n\nThe [collaborative ethos of open source](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/vim-experience-nvim-dev-experience/) enables developers across the globe to learn from each other, inspire innovative ideas, and create high-quality software. It is a philosophy that aligns perfectly with the famous words by Isaac Newton, \"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.\"\n\nOpen source is not just about sharing code. It's about building communities. It's about developers working together to solve complex problems and create solutions that are bigger than the sum of their parts. This collaborative spirit is aptly captured in Linus's Law: \"Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.\"\n\n```python\n# Example of an open source Python code snippet\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n\u003C=0:\n        return \"Input should be positive integer.\"\n    elif n==1:\n        return 0\n    elif n==2:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return fibonacci(n-1)+fibonacci(n-2)\n```\n\nOpen source platforms like GitHub have been instrumental in cultivating this culture.

One such tool that has revolutionized the way we think about CSS in the context of React is [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/). This library leverages the power of tagged template literals to provide a modern, streamlined, and component-based approach to styling your React applications. \n\n# Why Styled-components?\n\nStyled-components bring together the best of CSS and JS. It allows you to write actual CSS in your JavaScript, keeping your styles tied to your components. This eliminates the need to switch context between JS and CSS, making your development process smoother and more efficient.\n\n```javascript\nimport styled from 'styled-components';\n\nconst Button = styled.button`\n  background: palevioletred;\n  border-radius: 3px;\n  color: white;\n  margin: 0.5em 1em;\n  padding: 0.25em 1em;\n`;\n```\n\n# Embracing the Future with Styled-components\n\nStyled-components are not just about writing CSS in JS. They represent a shift in how we think about styling - moving away from global stylesheets to a component-centric approach. This aligns perfectly with React's philosophy of building small, reusable components and leads to more maintainable code. [Learn more about this philosophy here](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged).\n\n# The Power of Dynamic Styling\n\nOne great advantage of Styled-components is the ability to adapt styles based on props. This gives your styles the same flexibility and reusability that you get from your React components.\n\n```javascript\nconst Button = styled.button`\n  background: ${props => props.primary ? 'palevioletred' : 'white'};\n  color: ${props => props.primary ? 'white' : 'palevioletred'};\n`;\n\n\u003CButton primary>Primary Button\u003C/Button>\n\u003CButton>Default Button\u003C/Button>\n```\n\n# Wrapping up\n\nIn conclusion, Styled-components provide a powerful and flexible way of handling CSS in React. By integrating the best parts of CSS and JS, it provides an intuitive and efficient way of styling your React applications and is definitely worth considering for your next project.

They allow you to load JavaScript code on demand, which results in smaller bundle sizes and faster load times. \n\n\"Performance is a feature.\" - Jeff Atwood\n\nIn JavaScript, we traditionally use static import statements that load all the code at the start. This can lead to unnecessary load times for features that might not even be used by the user. Dynamic imports solve this issue by enabling you to import code only when it's needed.\n\n```javascript\nimport('./module').then(module => {\n  // Use module for something\n});\n```\n\nThis code snippet is an example of a dynamic import. The imported module will only be fetched when this code is executed, leading to faster initial load times.\n\nDynamic imports work particularly well with React's component-based architecture. You can dynamically import components and render them when they are needed. This technique is often combined with React Suspense to display a fallback while the component is being loaded.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';\n\nconst DynamicComponent = lazy(() => import('./DynamicComponent'));\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    \u003CSuspense fallback={\u003Cdiv>Loading...\u003C/div>}>\n      \u003CDynamicComponent />\n    \u003C/Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `DynamicComponent` is only loaded when `App` is rendered. Until it's loaded, the fallback is displayed.\n\nDynamic imports are a powerful tool in your performance optimization arsenal. They allow you to reduce initial load times and ensure a smoother user experience. As Donald Knuth said, \"Premature optimization is the root of all evil.\" But when it comes to web performance, a little optimization can go a long way.\n\nFor more tips on React performance optimization, check out these articles on [Incremental Faster Builds](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/gatsby-incremental-faster-builds-github-actions/), [Computed State in React](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/computed-state-in-react), and [Coding Standards with TypeScript](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged).\n\n---","src/content/hacks/react/dynamic-imports-boosting-performance/index.mdx","3dcd11f404050c42","react/enhance-your-coding-with-mobx-state-management-made-easy-for-react-applications",{"id":1084,"data":1086,"body":1093,"filePath":1094,"digest":1095,"deferredRender":22},{"title":1087,"path":1088,"description":1089,"type":595,"tags":1090,"published":22},"Enhance Your Coding With MobX - State Management Made Easy for React Applications","/hacks/react/enhance-your-coding-with-mobx-state-management-made-easy","Dive deep into MobX, a battle-tested package for easy state management in React applications.

Here's where MobX comes in. MobX simplifies state management, making your React application more maintainable and efficient.\n\n> \"Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.\" - Jeff Atwood\n\n# Installing and Setting Up MobX\n\nFirst, install MobX and MobX React binding in your project:\n\n```bash\nnpm install mobx mobx-react\n```\n\n# Creating an Observable State\n\nIn MobX, any data source that can change is an observable. Let's create a simple store with an observable state:\n\n```javascript\nimport { observable } from 'mobx';\n\nclass TodoStore {\n  @observable todos = [];\n}\n```\n\n# Updating and Using Observable State\n\nTo change the state, you simply assign a new value to it. And to use it, you can use the `observer` function from `mobx-react`:\n\n```javascript\nimport { observer } from 'mobx-react';\n\n@observer\nclass TodoList extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \u003Cdiv>\n        {this.props.store.todos.map(todo => \u003Cdiv>{todo}\u003C/div>)}\n      \u003C/div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n# Computing Derived Values\n\nMobX has a `computed` function that you can use to derive values from your state, similar to how you'd use selectors. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```javascript\nimport { observable, computed } from 'mobx';\n\nclass TodoStore {\n  @observable todos = [];\n  @computed get completedTodosCount() {\n    return this.todos.filter(todo => todo.completed === true).length;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n# Actions\n\nActions in MobX are methods that modify state.

Learn how Hooks simplify state management, improve performance, and enhance code reusability in your React applications.",[82,949,1008],"## Introduction to React Hooks\n\nReact Hooks, introduced in React 16.8, have revolutionized web development by enabling functional components to manage state and side effects. Hooks simplify code, enhance reusability, and improve performance, making them an indispensable tool for modern React developers.\n\n## Key Benefits of Using React Hooks\n\n### Simplified State Management\n\nReact Hooks like `useState` and `useReducer` allow developers to manage component states seamlessly. Unlike class components, functional components with Hooks are more concise and easier to understand.\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv>\n      \u003Cp>You clicked {count} times\u003C/p>\n      \u003Cbutton onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n        Click me\n      \u003C/button>\n    \u003C/div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Improved Performance\n\nHooks like `useMemo` and `useCallback` optimize performance by memoizing expensive calculations and callback functions. This ensures that the functions are only recalculated when necessary, reducing unnecessary renders.\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState, useMemo } from 'react';\n\nfunction ExpensiveComponent({ input }) {\n  const expensiveCalculation = (input) => {\n    // Simulate a heavy computation\n    return input * 2;\n  };\n\n  const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => expensiveCalculation(input), [input]);\n\n  return \u003Cdiv>{memoizedValue}\u003C/div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Enhanced Code Reusability\n\nCustom Hooks enable developers to extract and reuse logic across multiple components. This promotes cleaner code and reduces redundancy.\n\n```javascript\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction useFetch(url) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetch(url)\n      .then(response => response.json())\n      .then(data => {\n        setData(data);\n        setLoading(false);\n      });\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return { data, loading };\n}\n```\n\n### Simplified Side Effects Management\n\nThe `useEffect` Hook simplifies the management of side effects, such as data fetching and subscriptions. This replaces the need for lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`.\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction DataFetcher() {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')\n      .then(response => response.json())\n      .then(data => setData(data));\n  }, []);\n\n  return \u003Cdiv>{data ? data : 'Loading...'}\u003C/div>;\n}\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nReact Hooks have significantly transformed the landscape of web development. By simplifying state management, improving performance, and enhancing code reusability, Hooks empower developers to build sophisticated applications with less complexity. \n\nExplore the full potential of React Hooks and elevate your web development skills.

This avoids directly adding `async` to `useEffect` which could lead to race conditions. Also, remember to include any dependencies in the dependency array (the second argument to `useEffect`), in this case it's an empty array because we only want to fetch data once on component mount.\n\nBy following this pattern, you can effectively manage asynchronous operations within `useEffect`.

A controlled input accepts its current value as a prop and callback to change that value.\n\nHere is a simple example of a controlled input component in React:\n\n```jsx\nclass ControlledInput extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {value: ''};\n\n    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  handleChange(event) {\n    this.setState({value: event.target.value});\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \u003Cinput type=\"text\" value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this component, the value of the input is always driven by the React state. When you type in the input field, it triggers `handleChange` which updates the state, causing a re-render with the new value.\n\nThis setup gives you more control over your input elements and allows for more complex behaviors. It's a fundamental concept that will enhance your React development skills. \n\nRemember, the key is to keep your inputs controlled by maintaining the component's state as the single source of truth.","src/content/hacks/react/creating-controlled-inputs/index.mdx","d97cb6c2ec3007a4","react/handling-form-inputs-with-usestate",{"id":1140,"data":1142,"body":1148,"filePath":1149,"digest":1150,"deferredRender":22},{"title":1143,"path":1144,"description":1145,"type":595,"tags":1146,"published":22},"Handling React Form Inputs with useState","/hacks/react/handling-form-inputs-usestate","Learn how to handle form inputs in React using the useState hook.

Good programmers write code that humans can understand.\" - Martin Fowler. With this idea in our minds, let's simplify the process of implementing authentication in React applications.\n\n## Understanding Authentication\nAuthentication is a critical aspect of any application. It ensures that only authorized users can access specific functionalities of your app. There are several methods to implement this, but we are going to focus on a straightforward approach.\n\n## Implementing Authentication \nIn React, we can implement authentication using Context API and hooks. \n\n```javascript\nimport React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';\n\nconst AuthContext = createContext();\n\nexport function useAuth() {\n  return useContext(AuthContext);\n}\n\nexport function AuthProvider({ children }) {\n  const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState(null);\n\n  const value = {\n    currentUser,\n    setCurrentUser,\n  };\n\n  return (\n    \u003CAuthContext.Provider value={value}>\n      {children}\n    \u003C/AuthContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n```\nIn the above code, we create an `AuthContext` and two handy functions: `useAuth` and `AuthProvider`. You can check more about Context API and hooks from [here](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/setting-initial-state-with-usestate).\n\n## Using the Authentication\nWith the AuthProvider set up, wrap it around your application in the main component. Now, you can access the current user and the `setCurrentUser` function anywhere in your app using the `useAuth` hook.\n\n```javascript\nimport { useAuth } from './AuthProvider';\n...\nconst {currentUser, setCurrentUser} = useAuth();\n```\nIn the above code, `useAuth` allows us to access the current user and the `setCurrentUser` function anywhere in our app.\n\n## Conclusion\nAnd there you have it! A straightforward way to implement authentication in your React applications. Remember, the key to good software is simplicity and readability.

Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method. \n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useRef } from 'react';\n\nfunction ExampleComponent() {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    ref.current.focus();\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \u003C>\n      \u003Cinput ref={ref} type=\"text\" />\n      \u003Cbutton onClick={handleClick}>Focus the input\u003C/button>\n    \u003C/>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default ExampleComponent;\n```\n\nIn this example, useRef is used to create a ref to a DOM node, which can then be accessed and manipulated directly.\n\nRemember, useRef does not trigger re-renders when its content changes, unlike other state variables managed with useState or useReducer. It’s a more direct way of accessing values and doesn't trigger lifecycle events or additional renders. It’s a perfect solution when you need to store a mutable variable that doesn't impact the rendering of your component.\n\nHere are a few practical use cases where useRef comes in handy:\n\n- Storing the previous state of a component without triggering a re-render\n- Accessing and interacting with DOM nodes directly\n- Keeping track of timers or intervals\n\nFor more detailed scenarios and examples of using useRef, you might find these posts interesting: [Computed State in React](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/computed-state-in-react) and [Updating State with setState Callback](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/updating-state-with-setstate-callback).\n\nIn summary, useRef is a powerful hook that allows for more control over your React components.

This guide covers fundamental principles, best practices, and practical code snippets to help you elevate your React skills.",[82,1260,1008],"component-based-architecture","## Introduction to Component-Based Architecture\n\nComponent-based architecture is a paradigm shift in web development that promotes modular, reusable, and maintainable code. React, a powerful JavaScript library, has popularized this approach. Understanding how to master this architecture can significantly enhance your development workflow and application performance.\n\n## Key Principles of Component-Based Architecture\n\n### Reusability\n\nOne of the core tenets of component-based architecture is reusability. In React, components are self-contained units of code that can be reused across different parts of your application. This reduces redundancy and promotes consistency.\n\n```javascript\n// Reusable Button Component\nimport React from 'react';\n\nconst Button = ({ label, onClick }) => (\n  \u003Cbutton onClick={onClick}>\n    {label}\n  \u003C/button>\n);\n\nexport default Button;\n```\n\n### Modularity\n\nModularity allows developers to break down complex applications into smaller, manageable pieces. Each component is responsible for a specific piece of functionality, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.\n\n```javascript\n// Modularized Header Component\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Logo from './Logo';\nimport Navigation from './Navigation';\n\nconst Header = () => (\n  \u003Cheader>\n    \u003CLogo />\n    \u003CNavigation />\n  \u003C/header>\n);\n\nexport default Header;\n```\n\n### Maintainability\n\nA well-structured component-based architecture improves maintainability. Changes in one part of the application are less likely to impact others, making it easier to update and debug.\n\n**Quote:** \"Software is a great combination of artistry and engineering.\" - Bill Gates\n\n## Best Practices for Component-Based Architecture in React\n\n### Use Functional Components\n\nFunctional components are preferable over class components for their simplicity and performance benefits. They allow for a more concise syntax and are easier to test.\n\n```javascript\n// Functional Component Example\nconst Greeting = ({ name }) => \u003Ch1>Hello, {name}!\u003C/h1>;\n```\n\n### Leverage Hooks\n\nReact hooks, such as `useState` and `useEffect`, enable functional components to manage state and side effects, further enhancing code readability and maintainability.\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nconst Counter = () => {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    document.title = `Count: ${count}`;\n  }, [count]);\n\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv>\n      \u003Cp>{count}\u003C/p>\n      \u003Cbutton onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment\u003C/button>\n    \u003C/div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n### Prop Drilling and Context API\n\nTo avoid prop drilling, where props are passed through multiple levels of components, use the Context API. It provides a way to share values between components without explicitly passing props.\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext();\n\nconst ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');\n  return (\n    \u003CThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>\n      {children}\n    \u003C/ThemeContext.Provider>\n  );\n};\n\nconst ThemedComponent = () => {\n  const { theme } = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  return \u003Cdiv className={`theme-${theme}`}>Current Theme: {theme}\u003C/div>;\n};\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMastering component-based architecture with React involves understanding and applying principles of reusability, modularity, and maintainability. By leveraging functional components and hooks, you can create efficient, scalable, and maintainable applications.\n\nFor more in-depth tutorials and best practices, check out our [React Learning Path](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).\n\n## Call to Action\n\nReady to elevate your React skills?

This guide will walk you through different state management techniques and tools, helping you choose the best fit for your projects. \n\n### Understanding State in React\n\nState is an object that determines how a component renders and behaves. It allows React components to change their output over time in response to user actions, network responses, and anything else.\n\n```javascript\n// Example of a simple state in a React component\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv>\n      \u003Cp>You clicked {count} times\u003C/p>\n      \u003Cbutton onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n        Click me\n      \u003C/button>\n    \u003C/div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Counter;\n```\n\n### Local State vs Global State\n\nLocal state is confined to a single component, while global state is shared across multiple components.\n\n- **Local State**: Managed with `useState` or `useReducer`.\n- **Global State**: Managed with Context API, Redux, or third-party libraries.\n\n### Managing State with Context API\n\nThe Context API is a built-in solution for managing global state. It allows you to share state across the entire app without passing props down manually.\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { createContext, useState, useContext } from 'react';\n\nconst ThemeContext = createContext();\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');\n\n  return (\n    \u003CThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>\n      \u003CToolbar />\n    \u003C/ThemeContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Toolbar() {\n  return \u003CThemedButton />;\n}\n\nfunction ThemedButton() {\n  const { theme, setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  return (\n    \u003Cbutton\n      onClick={() => setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light')}\n      style={{ background: theme === 'light' ? '#fff' : '#333', color: theme === 'light' ? '#000' : '#fff' }}\n    >\n      Toggle Theme\n    \u003C/button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Advanced State Management with Redux\n\nRedux is a popular state management library that provides a single source of truth for the state of your application.\n\n```javascript\nimport { createStore } from 'redux';\n\n// Reducer function\nfunction counterReducer(state = { count: 0 }, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'INCREMENT':\n      return { count: state.count + 1 };\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n}\n\n// Create Redux store\nconst store = createStore(counterReducer);\n\n// Dispatch an action\nstore.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });\nconsole.log(store.getState()); // { count: 1 }\n```\n\n### Choosing the Right State Management Solution\n\nChoosing the right state management solution depends on the complexity of your application:\n\n- **Small Applications**: `useState` and `useContext` are often sufficient.\n- **Medium to Large Applications**: Consider using Redux or other advanced state management libraries like MobX or Recoil.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEffective state management is key to building robust React applications. Whether you opt for Context API or Redux, understanding the needs of your project will guide you to the best solution.\n\nFeel free to explore more about [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).\n\n> \"The best way to predict the future is to create it.\" – Peter Drucker\n\n### Call-to-Action\n\nReady to take your React skills to the next level?

It's a crucial part of working with React, and mastering it can significantly improve your projects. This post will guide you through the basics of `useEffect` and how to use it effectively.\n\n## Understanding Side Effects\n\nIn programming, a \"side effect\" is anything that affects something outside of the current function. In React, this could be data fetching, subscriptions, or manual DOM manipulation. These are all side effects that you can handle with `useEffect`.\n\n```javascript\nuseEffect(() => {\n  document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;\n}, [count]);\n```\n\nAbove, we are telling React to update the document title after React has updated the DOM. The second argument, `[count]`, is the list of dependencies for this effect.\n\n## Managing Dependencies\n\nThe dependency array is a list of variables that, when changed, will trigger the effect to run. If no array is provided, the effect will run after every render. If an empty array is provided, the effect will only run once, similar to `componentDidMount` in class components.\n\n```javascript\nuseEffect(() => {\n  // This runs ONCE after initial rendering\n}, []);\n```\n\n## Clean-up Function\n\nSometimes, an effect might require a clean-up. For example, if you're setting up a subscription in an effect, you also need to clean it up to prevent memory leaks. You can do this by returning a function from your effect.\n\n```javascript\nuseEffect(() => {\n  const subscription = props.source.subscribe();\n  return () => {\n    // Clean up the subscription\n    subscription.unsubscribe();\n  };\n}, [props.source]);\n```\n\nMastering `useEffect` can lead to more readable, maintainable code. It's an essential part of the React library, and understanding it thoroughly can make you a better developer.\n\n> \"Good code is its own best documentation.\" - Steve McConnell\n\nFor more on React, check out these posts on [setting initial state with useState](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/setting-initial-state-with-usestate), [computed state in React](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/computed-state-in-react), and [conditional rendering with && operator](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/conditional-rendering-with-and-operator).\n\nHappy coding!","src/content/hacks/react/mastering-useeffect-hook/index.mdx","9333fbf83dcb4ec0","react/preventing-default-behavior-in-event-handlers",{"id":1287,"data":1289,"body":1295,"filePath":1296,"digest":1297,"deferredRender":22},{"title":1290,"path":1291,"description":1292,"type":595,"tags":1293,"published":22},"Preventing Default Actions in Event Handlers","/hacks/react/preventing-default-actions-in-event-handlers","Learn how to prevent default actions in event handlers in React.

For instance, a form submission reloads the page by default. To prevent this, we can use the `event.preventDefault()` method. \n\nConsider a form submission event:\n\n```jsx\nclass Form extends React.Component {\n  handleSubmit(event) {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    // handle logic here\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \u003Cform onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>\n        \u003Cbutton type=\"submit\">Submit\u003C/button>\n      \u003C/form>\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, `event.preventDefault()` stops the default browser behavior of reloading the page on form submission. Instead, the `handleSubmit` function is executed.\n\nRemember, not all event handlers have default actions.

But did you know there are ways to make it even more efficient? Let's delve into an effective trick to optimize performance while using `useState` in your React applications.\n\n```javascript\nconst [state, setState] = React.useState(initialState);\n```\n\nIn normal circumstances, React re-renders the component every time state changes. However, sometimes, this isn't necessary. For example, if the new state is the same as the current state, a re-render can be avoided.\n\nA common way to prevent unnecessary re-renders is to use a function inside `setState`. This function receives the previous state as an argument and returns the new state. Only if the returned state is different from the current state will React trigger a re-render.\n\n```javascript\nsetState(prevState => {\n  if (prevState === newState) {\n    return prevState; // No re-render occurs\n  }\n\n  return newState; // Re-render occurs\n});\n```\n\nThis approach is particularly useful when dealing with complex state objects or arrays. It not only prevents unnecessary re-renders but also makes the code more readable and maintainable. \n\nTo get a deeper understanding of state management in React, refer to [this post](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/setting-initial-state-with-usestate) about setting initial state with `useState`. Also, learn about computed state in React in [this post](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/computed-state-in-react).\n\nRemember, as the famous computer scientist Donald Knuth once said, \"Premature optimization is the root of all evil\".

This comparative analysis explores performance, ease of use, and community support to guide your decision.\n\n## Performance\n\n### React\n\nReact, maintained by Facebook, is renowned for its efficient rendering using the Virtual DOM. This ensures minimal updates to the actual DOM, boosting performance.\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv>\n      \u003Cp>{count}\u003C/p>\n      \u003Cbutton onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment\u003C/button>\n    \u003C/div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Vue\n\nVue, created by Evan You, also uses a Virtual DOM but focuses on simplicity without sacrificing performance. Vue's reactivity system enables efficient updates.\n\n```html\n\u003Ctemplate>\n  \u003Cdiv>\n    \u003Cp>{{ count }}\u003C/p>\n    \u003Cbutton @click=\"increment\">Increment\u003C/button>\n  \u003C/div>\n\u003C/template>\n\n\u003Cscript>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      count: 0\n    };\n  },\n  methods: {\n    increment() {\n      this.count++;\n    }\n  }\n};\n\u003C/script>\n```\n\n## Ease of Use\n\n### React\n\nReact’s JSX syntax, while initially daunting, provides a powerful way to structure components. It offers a rich ecosystem and is ideal for large-scale applications.\n\n### Vue\n\nVue is often lauded for its gentle learning curve. Its single-file components (SFCs) encapsulate HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, making it highly intuitive, especially for beginners.\n\n## Community Support\n\n### React\n\nReact boasts a vast community and extensive documentation. Its popularity means a plethora of third-party libraries and tools, ensuring robust support for any project.\n\n### Vue\n\nVue’s community, while smaller, is incredibly dedicated. The official documentation is thorough, and the ecosystem is growing rapidly, making it a strong contender.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBoth React and Vue have their strengths. React is ideal for large, complex applications with its robust ecosystem and performance. Vue offers simplicity and ease of use, making it perfect for smaller to medium-sized projects. Your choice ultimately depends on your project requirements and team expertise.\n\n## Call-to-Action\n\nReady to take your development skills to the next level?

This allows us to conditionally render components in a clean and concise way.\n\nRemember that the condition should always return a boolean (`true` or `false`) for the ternary operator to work properly. \n\nMastering conditional rendering techniques such as these will allow you to create more dynamic and interactive user interfaces in React.\n\nHappy coding!","src/content/hacks/react/rendering-components-conditionally-with-ternary-operator/index.mdx","8550096b9113e5ef","react/rendering-lists-with-keys",{"id":1331,"data":1333,"body":1340,"filePath":1341,"digest":1342,"deferredRender":22},{"title":1334,"path":1335,"description":1336,"type":595,"tags":1337,"published":22},"Rendering Lists with Keys in React","/hacks/react/rendering-lists-with-keys","Learn how to efficiently render lists in React using keys.

It’s only search engine tricks that need to keep changing when the ranking algorithms change.\" - Jill Whalen\n\nIn today's competitive digital landscape, SEO optimization is more important than ever. A crucial factor in enhancing SEO is the method of rendering your application. Server-side rendering (SSR) has proven to be a game-changer in this regard.\n\nSSR is a popular technique for rendering a client-side, single-page application (SPA) on the server and then sending a fully rendered page to the client. The client's JavaScript bundle can then take over and the SPA can operate as normal. SSR is advantageous for SEO as it allows search engine crawlers to index your website more efficiently.\n\nHere's a brief example of how to implement SSR in a React application. \n\n```javascript\nimport express from 'express';\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOMServer from 'react-dom/server';\nimport App from './App';\n\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get('/*', (req, res) => {\n  const appHtml = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(\u003CApp />);\n  res.send(appHtml);\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, () => {\n  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');\n});\n```\n\nThis simple server uses Express.js to serve our application. When a GET request is made, the server will respond with a string of HTML generated by `ReactDOMServer.renderToString(\u003CApp />)`. \n\nWhile SSR can improve your SEO, it’s not without its challenges. It can be complex to set up and can add more load to your server. Therefore, it's important to balance the potential SEO benefits of SSR against these considerations.\n\nTo further enhance your React applications, you might consider using computed state ([link](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/computed-state-in-react)) or implementing coding standards with Husky and TypeScript ([link](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged)).\n\n\"SEO is not something you do anymore. It’s what happens when you do everything else right.\" - Chad Pollitt\n\nRemember, the ultimate goal of SEO is to improve the user experience and deliver high-quality, relevant content. SSR is just one part of this puzzle.\n\n---","src/content/hacks/react/server-side-rendering-for-seo-optimization/index.mdx","520d1de78c118794","react/simplifying-forms-in-react-with-formik",{"id":1355,"data":1357,"body":1363,"filePath":1364,"digest":1365,"deferredRender":22},{"title":1358,"path":1359,"description":1360,"type":595,"tags":1361,"published":22},"Simplifying Forms in React with Formik","/hacks/react/simplifying-forms-in-react-with-formik","Learn to simplify complex forms in React with Formik.

Managing form states, validation, and submission can be a cumbersome task. But with **Formik**, we can simplify this process.\n\nFormik is a small library that helps you with the 3 most annoying parts of forms in React:\n- Getting values in and out of form state\n- Validation and error messages\n- Handling form submission\n\nLet's dive into how we can leverage Formik to simplify our React forms.\n\n## Formik Installation\nYou can install Formik by running `npm install formik` or `yarn add formik` in your terminal.\n\n```bash\nnpm install formik\n```\n\n## Using Formik\nFormik provides a `Formik` component that we can use to wrap our form. This `Formik` component takes initial values for our form, an onSubmit function, and a function that returns our form.\n\nHere is an example of a simple form with Formik:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Formik, Field, Form } from 'formik';\n\nconst BasicForm = () => (\n  \u003CFormik\n    initialValues={{ email: '', password: '' }}\n    onSubmit={(values, { setSubmitting }) => {\n      setTimeout(() => {\n        alert(JSON.stringify(values, null, 2));\n        setSubmitting(false);\n      }, 400);\n    }}\n  >\n    {({ isSubmitting }) => (\n      \u003CForm>\n        \u003CField type=\"email\" name=\"email\" />\n        \u003CField type=\"password\" name=\"password\" />\n        \u003Cbutton type=\"submit\" disabled={isSubmitting}>\n          Submit\n        \u003C/button>\n      \u003C/Form>\n    )}\n  \u003C/Formik>\n);\n\nexport default BasicForm;\n```\n\nFormik simplifies forms in React, making our code cleaner and simpler to understand. For more complex examples and to understand how Formik handles form submission, validation, and error messages, check out the [Formik documentation](https://formik.org/docs/overview).\n\nRemember: \"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand.

This is particularly true when working with React and its related technologies. In this post, we'll dive deep into one tool that can significantly speed up your development process: Storybook.\n\nStorybook is a user interface (UI) component development environment for React, Vue, and Angular. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components.\n\n# Why Use Storybook?\n\nAs [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/) famously said, \"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.\" Storybook embraces this philosophy, making your components more understandable, robust, and reusable.\n\nStorybook provides a sandbox to build UI components in isolation so you can develop hard-to-reach states and edge cases. This isolation simplifies the process and makes it more efficient, allowing you to develop components in various states, irrespective of the complexities of your application's logic.\n\nHere is a basic example of a Storybook setup:\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Button } from './Button';\n\nexport default {\n  title: 'Button',\n  component: Button,\n};\n\nconst Template = (args) => \u003CButton {...args} />;\n\nexport const Primary = Template.bind({});\nPrimary.args = {\n  primary: true,\n  label: 'Button',\n};\n```\n\nIn this snippet, we've defined a Button component with two states, primary and secondary. This setup in Storybook allows us to preview these states separately without the need to set up complex environment configuration.\n\n# Integrating Storybook into Your Workflow\n\nIntegrating Storybook into your workflow could significantly enhance your productivity. It allows you to work on one component at a time and ensure its robustness before integrating it into the application. By using Storybook, you can structure your components, pages, and even entire screens without needing to stand up a server or build out screens.\n\nFor a detailed guide on integrating Storybook into your workflow, check out this [handy guide](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged).\n\n# Enhancing Testing with Storybook\n\nAnother advantage of Storybook is that it enhances the testing experience. With Storybook, you can visually test your application during development. It makes it easy to spot and fix bugs before they even reach your users. For more information on testing in React, you may refer to this [informative post](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/adding-event-handlers-in-jsx).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Storybook is a powerful tool for developing and testing React UI components. It encourages the development of reusable components, which in turn leads to more robust applications and faster development cycles. As [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/) rightly said, \"Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad.\" With Storybook, your components' purpose and functionality become self-explanatory, making your code easier to understand and maintain.\n\nFor more in-depth guides on React and its related technologies, feel free to explore the rest of the [blog](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/).","src/content/hacks/react/speeding-up-development-with-storybook-an-in-depth-review-of-the-react-ui-component-workshop/index.mdx","c46ba06c5604a60c","react/understanding-and-using-context-api",{"id":1389,"data":1391,"body":1396,"filePath":1397,"digest":1398,"deferredRender":22},{"title":1392,"path":1393,"description":1394,"type":595,"tags":1395,"published":22},"Understanding and Using Context API","/hacks/react/understanding-and-utilizing-context-api","Dive deep into Understanding and Using Context API in React.

Good programmers write code that humans can understand.\" — Martin Fowler.\n\nWhen it comes to state management in React, Context API is a game changer. It provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level, a concept known as \"prop drilling\".\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { createContext, useState } from \"react\";\n\n// Create a Context\nconst MyContext = createContext();\n\n// Create a Provider Component\nexport const MyProvider = props => {\n  const [state, setState] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    \u003CMyContext.Provider value={[state, setState]}>\n      {props.children}\n    \u003C/MyContext.Provider>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default MyContext;\n```\n\nThe above code sets up a simple Context API, where `MyProvider` is a provider component wrapping the children that will need access to the context. The `value` prop on `MyContext.Provider` is the value that will be available to all children components.\n\nUsing the Context in a child component is straightforward. Import the context, and use the `useContext` hook to access the state and the `setState` function.\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useContext } from \"react\";\nimport MyContext from \"./MyContext\";\n\nconst ChildComponent = () => {\n  const [state, setState] = useContext(MyContext);\n\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv>\n      \u003Cp>{state}\u003C/p>\n      \u003Cbutton onClick={() => setState(state + 1)}>Increase\u003C/button>\n    \u003C/div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, we're importing the context and using the `useContext` hook to get the state and the `setState` function. We can then use these in our component as we would with local state.\n\nContext API is an efficient and scalable way to manage state in large React applications. It allows you to avoid prop drilling and keep your codebase more readable and maintainable.

They enable you to leverage state and other React features without having to write a class. \n\n```javascript\n  import React, { useState } from 'react';\n  \n  const Example = () => {\n    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  \n    return (\n      \u003Cdiv>\n        \u003Cp>You clicked {count} times\u003C/p>\n        \u003Cbutton onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n          Click me\n        \u003C/button>\n      \u003C/div>\n    );\n  }\n```\n\nIn the above example, `useState` is a Hook. The `useState` hook lets you add state to functional components. In classes, the state is always an object, and you can store any data type in them. With the `useState` Hook, you can work with a single value like a number or string, not just objects.\n\nReact Hooks also include `useEffect`, a powerful way to perform side-effects in your application. It serves the same purpose as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in React classes, but unified into a single API.\n\n```javascript\n  import React, { useEffect } from 'react';\n  \n  const Example = () => {\n    useEffect(() => {\n      document.title = `Updated title`;\n    });\n  \n    return (\n      \u003Cdiv>\n        \u003Cp>Check the document title.\u003C/p>\n      \u003C/div>\n    );\n  }\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `useEffect` hook updates the document's title after React updates the DOM. This behavior is similar to what happens in the `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method in class components.\n\nReact Hooks provide a more direct API to the React concepts you already know: props, state, context, refs, and lifecycle. They don’t fundamentally change how React works, but they do make your React code cleaner and easier to read. \n\nFor more in-depth understanding, check these: [Conditional Rendering](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/conditional-rendering-with-and-operator), [Mapping Arrays to JSX Elements](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/mapping-arrays-to-jsx-elements), and [Destructuring Props](https://samuellawrentz.com/hacks/react/destructuring-props-in-functional-components) in React.\n\nAs the saying goes, “Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.\" So, why not make it more efficient, readable, and manageable with React Hooks?\n\nRemember, \"The first step to better code is understanding it.\" Unleash the power of React Hooks today and take your React code to the next level.","src/content/hacks/react/unleash-the-power-of-react-hooks/index.mdx","3432708f88bb190e","react/unleashing-the-power-of-react-for-web-development-a-comprehensive-guide",{"id":1410,"data":1412,"body":1417,"filePath":1418,"digest":1419,"deferredRender":22},{"title":1413,"path":1414,"description":1415,"type":595,"tags":1416,"published":22},"Unleashing the Power of React for Web Development: A Comprehensive Guide","/hacks/react/unleashing-the-power-of-react","Discover how to unleash the power of React for web development. This comprehensive guide covers key features, benefits, and practical tips to boost your web projects with React.",[82,1008,18],"## Introduction to React\n\nReact, developed by Facebook, has revolutionized the way we build web applications. Its component-based architecture allows developers to create reusable UI components, making code more efficient and easier to maintain. With a vibrant ecosystem and strong community support, React is an excellent choice for modern web development.\n\n## Key Features of React\n\n### Component-Based Architecture\n\nReact's component-based architecture promotes reusability and modularity. Components are the building blocks of a React application and can be nested, managed independently, and combined to form complex UIs. Here's a simple example of a React component:\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\n\nfunction Greeting(props) {\n  return \u003Ch1>Hello, {props.name}!\u003C/h1>;\n}\n\nexport default Greeting;\n```\n\n### Virtual DOM\n\nReact utilizes a Virtual DOM to enhance performance. Instead of manipulating the actual DOM directly, React creates a virtual representation of the DOM and updates it in a more efficient manner. This leads to faster rendering and improved user experience.\n\n### JSX Syntax\n\nJSX, or JavaScript XML, is a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It makes the code more readable and easier to understand. For instance:\n\n```javascript\nconst element = \u003Ch1>Hello, world!\u003C/h1>;\n```\n\n### Hooks\n\nIntroduced in React 16.8, Hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Commonly used Hooks include `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`. Here's an example using `useState`:\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    \u003Cdiv>\n      \u003Cp>You clicked {count} times\u003C/p>\n      \u003Cbutton onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n        Click me\n      \u003C/button>\n    \u003C/div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Counter;\n```\n\n## Benefits of Using React\n\n### Efficiency\n\nReact's Virtual DOM and efficient updating process reduce the load on the browser, resulting in faster performance and a smoother user experience.\n\n### Flexibility\n\nWith React, developers can build applications for various platforms, including web, mobile (React Native), and even desktop applications. This flexibility makes it a versatile tool for any project.\n\n### Strong Community and Ecosystem\n\nReact boasts a large, active community, providing a wealth of resources, libraries, and tools. Popular libraries such as Redux for state management, React Router for navigation, and Material-UI for UI components enhance React's functionality.\n\n## Practical Tips for React Development\n\n1. **Use Functional Components**: Prefer functional components over class components for most use cases. They are easier to read, test, and debug.\n2. **State Management**: Use state management libraries like Redux or Context API for handling global state.\n3. **Code Splitting**: Implement code splitting using React's `lazy` and `Suspense` to improve load times.\n4. **Testing**: Write unit tests using libraries like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure your components work as expected.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nReact has transformed the way developers approach web development. Its component-based architecture, Virtual DOM, and vibrant ecosystem make it a powerful tool for building modern web applications. By leveraging React's features and best practices, you can create efficient, scalable, and high-performing web projects.\n\n### Call to Action\n\nReady to take your web development skills to the next level?

This post will dive deep into the concepts and usage of React Redux, aiming to unlock its potential for your modern web applications.\n\n## What is React Redux?\n\nReact Redux is the official React UI bindings layer for Redux. It lets your React components read data from a Redux store and dispatch actions to the store to update the state. \n\n```javascript\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\nimport { Provider } from 'react-redux'\n\nconst store = createStore(reducer)\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  \u003CProvider store={store}>\n    \u003CApp />\n  \u003C/Provider>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n)\n```\n\n## Understanding Redux\n\nBefore diving into React Redux, it's essential to understand [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). It's a predictable state container for JavaScript applications that helps you write applications that behave consistently and are easy to test. \n\n```javascript\nfunction counter(state = 0, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'INCREMENT':\n      return state + 1\n    case 'DECREMENT':\n      return state - 1\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nlet store = createStore(counter)\n```\n\n## Using React Redux\n\nTo use React Redux, you need to wrap your root component with the `Provider` component. This makes the Redux store available to any nested components that have been wrapped in the `connect()` function.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Provider } from 'react-redux'\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  \u003CProvider store={store}>\n    \u003CApp />\n  \u003C/Provider>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n)\n```\n\nThe `connect()` function connects a React component to the Redux store, providing the connected component with the pieces of the data it needs from the store.\n\n```javascript\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\n\nconst VisibleTodoList = connect(\n  mapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(TodoList)\n\nexport default VisibleTodoList\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\nWhile React Redux is a powerful tool, it's important to use it appropriately to gain the most benefits. Always remember to keep your reducers pure, avoid mutation, and organize your state in a normalized manner. Also, consider using Redux middleware like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga for asynchronous actions.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nReact Redux is a potent tool for state management in large-scale React applications. It provides a predictable state container that makes your applications behave consistently, leading to better scalability and maintainability. Understanding its concepts and how to use it effectively can significantly impact your web application development journey. \n\nAs [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov), the creator of Redux, once said, \"Redux makes it possible to reason about your state in a way that it wouldn't be possible if you didn't have it.\"\n\nFor more insights into React and related technologies, check out these other posts:\n1.

This ensures the correct `this` context even when the function is passed as a callback.\n\nUnlike regular functions, arrow functions don't define their own `this` context. This makes them excellent for handling events in React, where you often need to access component properties within event handlers.\n\nRemember, if you were to use a regular function for the event handler, you would need to bind `this` in the constructor, adding unnecessary lines of code.\n\n```javascript\nclass SampleComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  handleClick() {\n    console.log('Button clicked');\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \u003Cbutton onClick={this.handleClick}>\n        Click me\n      \u003C/button>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\nMastering the use of arrow functions in event handlers is a crucial step towards becoming a proficient React developer.","src/content/hacks/react/using-arrow-functions-in-event-handlers/index.mdx","cb3eedb31a04cb86","react/using-defaultprops-for-default-props",{"id":1453,"data":1455,"body":1461,"filePath":1462,"digest":1463,"deferredRender":22},{"title":1456,"path":1457,"description":1458,"type":595,"tags":1459,"published":22},"Using defaultProps in React","/hacks/react/using-defaultprops-for-default-props","Learn how to use defaultProps in React to set default values for your props.

Learn how to navigate these dilemmas responsibly.",[874,923,1548],"tech-responsibility","## Introduction\n\nIn the rapidly evolving world of software development, ethical dilemmas are becoming increasingly prevalent. Issues such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the implications of artificial intelligence are forcing developers to reconsider the impact of their work. This blog post delves into these ethical challenges and offers insights into navigating them responsibly.\n\n## Data Privacy\n\nData privacy is one of the most pressing ethical concerns in software development. With the advent of big data, developers now have access to vast amounts of personal information. This raises questions about how this data should be collected, stored, and used.\n\nFor instance, consider the implementation of a user tracking system:\n\n```python\nimport uuid\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef track_user_activity(user_id):\n    activity_id = uuid.uuid4()\n    timestamp = datetime.now()\n    # Store user activity in the database\n    # Ensure data encryption and anonymization\n    save_to_db(activity_id, user_id, timestamp)\n```\n\nWhile tracking user activity can improve user experience, it also poses risks to user privacy. Developers must ensure data encryption and anonymization to protect user identities.\n\n## Algorithmic Bias\n\nAlgorithmic bias is another critical ethical issue. Machine learning models can unintentionally perpetuate biases present in training data. This can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.\n\nConsider a hiring algorithm example:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n\ndef train_model(training_data):\n    model = LogisticRegression()\n    model.fit(training_data['features'], training_data['labels'])\n    # Evaluate model for bias\n    evaluate_model_for_bias(model)\n    return model\n```\n\nIn this scenario, evaluating the model for bias is crucial. Failing to do so could result in the exclusion of qualified candidates based on gender, race, or other protected characteristics.\n\n## The Impact of AI\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) presents a unique set of ethical challenges. AI systems can make decisions that affect human lives, such as in healthcare or criminal justice. Ensuring these systems are transparent and accountable is vital.\n\nAs Andrew Ng, a pioneer in AI, stated:\n\n> \"AI is the new electricity. It has the potential to transform every industry. But with great power comes great responsibility.\"\n\nDevelopers must adopt frameworks that promote transparency and accountability in AI systems.\n\n## Open Source and Security\n\nOpen source software offers numerous benefits, including transparency and community collaboration. However, it also raises ethical concerns related to security and intellectual property.\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\n// Example of a security flaw in open source code\nfunction authenticate(user, password) {\n    if (user === 'admin' && password === 'password') {\n        return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n```\n\nThis simple authentication function contains a hard-coded password, posing a significant security risk. Ethical developers should follow best practices to avoid such pitfalls.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNavigating the ethical dilemmas in software development requires a commitment to responsible practices. Developers must prioritize data privacy, address algorithmic bias, ensure AI accountability, and adhere to security best practices. By doing so, they can contribute to a more ethical and equitable tech industry.\n\n**Call to Action:** Stay informed and proactive about ethical issues in software development.

Agile and Waterfall are two primary philosophies that shape how teams work. Understanding their principles, benefits, and challenges can help you make an informed decision.\n\n## Agile Methodology\n\n### Principles and Practices\n\nAgile emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility. Teams work in **sprints**, short cycles aimed at delivering a functional product increment.\n\nKey principles include:\n1. **Customer Collaboration**: Engaging customers throughout the development process.\n2. **Adaptive Planning**: Adjusting plans based on feedback and changes.\n3. **Continuous Improvement**: Iterating on processes and products to improve quality.\n\n### Benefits\n\n- **Flexibility**: Agile allows for changes and refinements at any stage.\n- **Customer Satisfaction**: Continuous customer involvement often leads to a product that better meets user needs.\n- **Team Collaboration**: Enhanced communication and collaboration improve overall efficiency.\n\n### Challenges\n\n- **Scope Creep**: Flexibility can sometimes lead to unmanageable scope changes.\n- **Time Management**: Meeting sprint deadlines consistently can be stressful.\n\nHere's a simple Agile workflow in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define a simple sprint backlog\nsprint_backlog = [\"user_authentication\", \"user_profile\", \"dashboard\"]\n\n# Function to simulate a sprint\ndef run_sprint(backlog):\n    completed_tasks = []\n    for task in backlog:\n        # Simulate task completion\n        completed_tasks.append(f\"Completed {task}\")\n    return completed_tasks\n\n# Run a sprint\ncompleted = run_sprint(sprint_backlog)\nfor task in completed:\n    print(task)\n```\n\n## Waterfall Methodology\n\n### Principles and Practices\n\nWaterfall follows a linear, sequential approach. Each phase must be completed before moving to the next, typically including requirements, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance.\n\nKey phases include:\n1. **Requirement Analysis**: Gathering and documenting project requirements.\n2. **System Design**: Creating architecture and design documents.\n3. **Implementation**: Coding and integrating the system.\n4. **Testing**: Verifying and validating the system.\n5. **Maintenance**: Ongoing support and updates.\n\n### Benefits\n\n- **Clear Structure**: Well-defined phases make it easy to manage and track progress.\n- **Documentation**: Extensive documentation helps in maintaining and scaling the project.\n- **Predictability**: Fixed stages allow for accurate budgeting and scheduling.\n\n### Challenges\n\n- **Inflexibility**: Changes are costly and difficult to implement once a phase is completed.\n- **Delayed Testing**: Issues are often discovered late in the cycle, leading to higher correction costs.\n\nHere's a simple Waterfall process in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\n// Define project phases\nconst phases = [\"Requirements\", \"Design\", \"Implementation\", \"Testing\", \"Maintenance\"];\n\n// Simulate phase completion\nphases.forEach(phase => {\n    console.log(`Completing ${phase} phase`);\n});\n```\n\n## Choosing the Right Methodology\n\nSelecting between Agile and Waterfall depends on project needs:\n\n- **Agile**: Ideal for dynamic projects with evolving requirements.\n- **Waterfall**: Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and less scope for change.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding Agile and Waterfall methodologies helps you choose the best approach for your software projects. Whether you need flexibility and rapid iterations or structured, linear progression, both have their place in effective project management.\n\n**Call to Action**: Ready to dive deeper?

This ideology fosters an environment of shared knowledge and continuous improvement.\n\n### Key Principles of Open Source\n\n1. **Transparency**: OSS promotes transparency by allowing anyone to inspect the code. This openness can lead to more secure and reliable software, as developers worldwide can identify and fix vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Collaboration**: By encouraging collaboration, OSS leverages the collective expertise of a global community. This diverse input can result in more innovative solutions and faster problem-solving.\n\n3. **Freedom**: Users have the freedom to use the software for any purpose, study how it works, and modify it to suit their needs. This freedom is often protected by licenses like the GNU General Public License (GPL).\n\n> \"The power of open source is the power of the people. The people rule.\" – Philippe Kahn\n\n### Benefits of Open Source Software\n\n1. **Cost-Effectiveness**: OSS is typically free to use, which reduces costs for businesses and individuals. This can be particularly advantageous for startups and small enterprises.\n\n2. **Security**: With more eyes on the code, security vulnerabilities can be identified and patched more quickly. This proactive approach often results in more secure software.\n\n3. **Flexibility and Customization**: Users can tailor the software to meet their specific needs. Customization can range from minor tweaks to significant overhauls, providing a level of flexibility that proprietary software often lacks.\n\n```python\n# Example of an Open Source Python function\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    while a \u003C n:\n        yield a\n        a, b = b, a + b\n\n# Usage\nfor num in fibonacci(10):\n    print(num)\n```\n\n### Challenges of Open Source Software\n\n1. **Support and Documentation**: OSS may lack the professional support and comprehensive documentation that proprietary software offers. Users might need to rely on community forums and tutorials.\n\n2. **Compatibility Issues**: Integrating OSS with existing systems can sometimes be challenging. Compatibility issues may arise, requiring additional resources to resolve.\n\n3. **Quality Control**: While many OSS projects are high-quality, others may suffer from inconsistent coding standards and lack of regular updates.\n\n### The Impact on the Tech Industry\n\nOpen source has revolutionized the tech industry by democratizing software development. It has enabled rapid innovation, fostered global collaboration, and driven down costs. Major tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and IBM have embraced open source, contributing to and leveraging OSS in their products and services.\n\n### Conclusion and Call to Action\n\nThe philosophy behind open source software is rooted in principles of freedom, collaboration, and transparency. While it offers numerous benefits, it also presents certain challenges. Understanding these facets can help businesses and developers make informed decisions about integrating OSS into their workflows.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring open source projects or contributing to the community, check out platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/).

It posits that individuals are free and responsible agents determining their development through acts of the will. This school of thought became prominent in the 20th century, with roots tracing back to the 19th century.\n\n### Core Principles of Existentialism\n\n1. **Existence Precedes Essence**: This principle, popularized by Jean-Paul Sartre, suggests that individuals are not born with a predetermined purpose. Instead, they create their essence through actions and choices.\n\n2. **Freedom and Responsibility**: Existentialists believe that individuals are free to make their own choices. However, with this freedom comes the burden of responsibility for the consequences of those choices.\n\n3. **Absurdity and Meaning**: Life is inherently meaningless, and it is up to each individual to find or create meaning in their own lives. This concept is often associated with Albert Camus, who described the human situation as fundamentally absurd.\n\n4. **Authenticity**: Living authentically means being true to one's own values and beliefs, rather than conforming to societal expectations. This idea was central to the works of Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\n### Notable Existentialist Philosophers\n\n- **Søren Kierkegaard**: Often considered the father of existentialism, Kierkegaard emphasized the importance of personal choice and commitment.\n- **Friedrich Nietzsche**: Known for his declaration that \"God is dead,\" Nietzsche explored themes of nihilism and the creation of personal values.\n- **Jean-Paul Sartre**: A leading figure in existentialism, Sartre's works focus on the concepts of freedom, responsibility, and bad faith.\n- **Albert Camus**: Though he rejected the label of existentialist, Camus' exploration of absurdity and rebellion aligns closely with existentialist themes.\n\n### Existentialism in Modern Thought\n\nExistentialism has significantly influenced literature, psychology, theology, and popular culture. It has inspired writers like Franz Kafka and Fyodor Dostoevsky, whose works delve into existential themes. In psychology, existential therapy helps individuals confront the inherent challenges of existence, such as isolation, death, and meaninglessness.\n\n### Code Example: Existential Decision-Making Simulation\n\nHere's a simple Python code snippet that simulates existential decision-making by generating random choices and evaluating their outcomes:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nchoices = [\"pursue passion\", \"conform to society\", \"seek pleasure\", \"avoid pain\"]\n\ndef make_choice():\n    return random.choice(choices)\n\ndef evaluate_choice(choice):\n    if choice == \"pursue passion\":\n        return \"Authentic life with challenges.\"\n    elif choice == \"conform to society\":\n        return \"Comfortable but unfulfilling life.\"\n    elif choice == \"seek pleasure\":\n        return \"Transient happiness.\"\n    elif choice == \"avoid pain\":\n        return \"Safe but limited life.\"\n\nchoice = make_choice()\noutcome = evaluate_choice(choice)\n\nprint(f\"Choice: {choice}\\nOutcome: {outcome}\")\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nExistentialism challenges us to confront the freedom and responsibility of shaping our own lives. It encourages us to live authentically and find personal meaning amidst the absurdity of existence.\n\n> \"Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does.\" - Jean-Paul Sartre\n\n---\n\n### Call-to-Action\n\nDive deeper into existentialism by exploring our comprehensive [Existentialism Guide](https://www.example.com/existentialism-guide).
