**Core Aesthetic:**
- Clean, modern, professional developer blog
- Minimalist with purposeful detail — no clutter
- Color palette: deep slate blues, cool teals, muted purples, warm accents (amber/coral sparingly)
- Semi-flat illustration style with subtle depth (soft shadows, gentle gradients)
- Must look good on both dark and light backgrounds

**Subject Matter:**
- Abstract representations of technical concepts (not literal screenshots)
- Geometric patterns, flowing data streams, node graphs
- Code fragments as decorative elements (not readable code)
- Developer workspace motifs: terminals, editors, component trees
- Conceptual metaphors: building blocks, interconnected systems, flow diagrams

**Composition:**
- Strong focal point, visually balanced
- Readable and recognizable at thumbnail size (blog cards)
- Leave breathing room — avoid edge-to-edge detail
- Subtle texture or grain for warmth

**Typography Integration:**
- Do NOT include any text, labels, or typography in the image
- The image should work as a pure visual without words

**Avoid:**
- Generic stock imagery (handshakes, people pointing at screens)
- Overly busy or cluttered compositions
- Neon/cyberpunk aesthetics
- Photorealistic style — keep it illustrative
- AI-generated artifacts, extra fingers, distorted elements
- Bright saturated colors that clash with a muted palette

**Mood:** Thoughtful, expert, approachable. Like a well-designed conference talk slide — technical depth presented with visual elegance.`;
