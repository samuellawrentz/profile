It was a fine day, I pulled up my phone and was mindlessly scrolling youtube. I came across a video by ThePrimegen about how he uses Vim and was talking about how it sped up his workflow. First I wasn't paying attention, then when I started to look - Man!, he was on fire. He navigated so quickly that even I had to pause and rewind the video a multiple times. I was awestruck.

Then I went down the rabbit hole (blackhole) of Vim and Nvim. I spent hours researching on this topic. I started to feel a pull towards this IDE stuff. Right
