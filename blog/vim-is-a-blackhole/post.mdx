It was a fine day, I pulled up my phone and was mindlessly scrolling youtube. I came across a video by ThePrimegen about how he uses Vim and was talking about how it sped up his workflow. First I wasn't paying attention, then when I started to look - Man!, he was on fire. He navigated so quickly that even I had to pause and rewind the video a multiple times. I was awestruck.

Then I went down the rabbit hole (blackhole) of Vim and Nvim. I spent hours researching on this topic. I started to feel a pull towards this IDE stuff. Right now, I'm in the middle of setting up my own personal IDE. I'm not able to sleep. I'm going crazy. I was in this phase 2 months ago.

Now I have a decent setup. I'm able to do most of the things that I used to do in VSCode. I'm still learning and improving my setup. I'll write a detailed post about my setup soon. I still have VSCode for some of the things that I'm not able to do in Vim. I'm still learning and improving my setup.

I've integrated the following tools into my setup:

1. Tmux
2. FZF
3. Ripgrep
4. Telescope
5. LSP
6. Treesitter
7. Nvim-tree
8. Statusline
9. Nvim-compe
10. Harpoon
11. Github Copilot
12. Lazygit

These are the tools that I require the most. Life becomes so much easier with simple tools. Everyone should have a personal IDE. It helps you learn a lot of things. This post was half written by Copilot.
