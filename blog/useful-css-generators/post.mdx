CSS has evolved greatly in recent years. A lot of things can be done using CSS alone. This not only improves performance it also makes the life of the developer easier instead of writing a lot of Javascript code. Also, a great variety of things can be done with CSS.

  

I have gathered a list of CSS generators from various sources which could be helpful. Let me know in the comments if you’ve used any of these tools. Okay, let's go!

  

## 1. Stripes Generator
    

You can generate any kind of stripe background using this generator. This might come in handy when you have some complex stripe to be created.

## 4.  Accordion/Collapse generator
    

If you are a web dev surely you would have come across creating an accordion. We would have searched some UI library or some snippet that we had to modify based on our needs. That job is tedious and hence this tool exists.

  

Create accordions just by moving some sliders. - [https://accordionslider.com/](https://accordionslider.com/)

## 5. Layout Generator
    

I’m sure you would have spent a good amount of time trying to laying out things properly. And even if we did, we would forget the responsive aspect of the layout. This tool helps you create layouts with ease.

## 6. Animations and CSS helper tools
    

This tool helps you create animations based on steps. You just have to define how the element should look at each step and it generates the heavy CSS for you. They also have some additional cool tools to generate shadows and colors.
