Hey there, folks! I'm back, and it's like I've been resurrected from the technological grave! You might have noticed my absence for a while. Well, let me tell you, it's been a rollercoaster ride in the realm of ones and zeros. I was juggling work and attempting to resuscitate my website, which seemed deader than a doornail in the ever-evolving world of tech. I donned my digital knight armor and embarked on a quest to save it from oblivion. Strap in and let's dive into this epic saga of revival.

## The Techocalypse

Picture this: One fateful day, out of nowhere, my trusty local setup for the website decided to throw in the towel. I was still rocking Gatsby v2 when Gatsby v3, 4, and 5 were partying. Meanwhile, Node.js had a whole coming-of-age journey, skyrocketing to v18 and 19, and npm decided to take the fast track to v7. My website's tech stack was stuck in a time warp, with Gatsby v2, Node v12, and npm v6.

I was on the brink of a tech-nervous breakdown. Every build attempt greeted me with an error message that seemed to have its own cryptic language. I tried to wrangle it into submission, but it was like trying to teach a squirrel to ride a unicycle â€“ frustrating and futile. My work was piling up, and I thought, "I'll fix it later." Little did I know, that "later" would become a never-ending saga.

### My Search Odyssey

If you peeked into my search history, you'd find the same error message searched more times than I've had cups of coffee. I was on the brink of losing my sanity, but a tiny spark of determination kept me going. I couldn't just abandon my website to the digital abyss; it had to rise from the ashes like a phoenix.

##### Here are few snapshots of my search history:
I was listening to music at the same time so you can see quite of music related history as well. One cannot live without music, right?

## How I Pulled It Off

So, how did I manage to resurrect my digital brainchild? Well, it was a mix of lightning-fast typing and relentless Google searches.
