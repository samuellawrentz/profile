Have you ever struggled with inconsistent Git commit messages in your organization's repositories? If so, you're not alone. I too found myself frustrated by this issue, and I went in search of a VS Code extension that could help enforce a standardized format for commit messages. Unfortunately, I was unable to find an extension that met my needs. So, I decided to build my own! 

In this post, I'll share with you the story of how I built a custom VS Code extension in JavaScript to streamline Git workflows and ensure consistent commit messages. With this extension, developers can prefill the SCM commit input box with a commit message in the format `(\<Ticket number\>) \<Type\>: `, where the ticket number and type of commit are selected by the user. This format helps ensure consistency and clarity across commit messages based on your organization's [coding standards](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged).

## The Problem

Inconsistent Git commit messages can be a major headache for developers and project managers alike. Without a standard format for commit messages, it can be difficult to track changes, understand the purpose of a commit, and identify which tickets or issues a commit is related to. In my own organization, we struggled with inconsistent commit messages across various repositories, and I knew there had to be a better way.

## The Solution

After searching for a VS Code extension that could help standardize our commit messages, I realized that I would need to build my own. Fortunately, creating a custom VS Code extension in JavaScript is relatively straightforward, especially if you are familiar with cutting-edge development experiences like [Neovim](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/vim-experience-nvim-dev-experience/).

To begin, I used the [VS Code Extension Generator](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension) to create a basic extension template. 

The extension, written in JavaScript, adds a new command to VS Code called createCommitMessage. When the user executes this command, it prompts them to enter a ticket number and select a type of commit (such as "feat", "fix", or "chore"). It then constructs a commit message in the format (\<Ticket number\>) \<Type\>: , and pre-fills the Git commit input box with this message. The user can then add their own commit message and complete the commit as usual. It's as simple as creating [bookmarklets](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/bookmarklets/).

## The Code
This is not the actual code, but something similar is used. You can check the repository for more details.

```js
function activate(context) {
  let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('extension.createCommitMessage', function () {
    vscode.window.showInputBox({
      prompt: 'Enter the ticket number'
    }).then(ticketNumber => {
      if (!ticketNumber) return;
      vscode.window.showQuickPick(['feat', 'fix', 'chore'], {
        placeHolder: 'Select the type of commit'
      }).then(type => {
        if (!type) return;
        const commitMessage = `(${ticketNumber}) ${type}: `;
        const gitExtension = vscode.extensions.getExtension('vscode.git');
        if (!gitExtension) {
          vscode.window.showErrorMessage('Git extension not found');
          return;
        }
        const api = gitExtension.exports.getAPI(1);
        if (!api.repositories.length) {
          vscode.window.showErrorMessage('No Git repository found');
          return;
        }
        const repo = api.repositories[0];
        repo.inputBox.value = commitMessage;
      });
    });
  });
  context.subscriptions.push(disposable);
}
```

This code defines an activate function that registers the createCommitMessage command. When the command is executed, it uses showInputBox and showQuickPick to prompt the user for input, constructs a commit message in the desired format, and sets the value property of the Git commit input box to the message. 

Overall, this extension provides a simple way to standardize commit messages across your organization and improve the consistency and clarity of your Git repositories. It's like having a [personalized coding standard](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged) for every commit message.
