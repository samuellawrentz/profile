For a long time, I was against the use of modern CSS properties and tools. This was because the organization that I used to work for supports older versions of [Internet Explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_version_history#:~:text=The%20first%20version%20of%20Internet,other%20companies%20initiating%20browser%20development.). So Flexbox and Grid were out of the equation. It was just `position` `display` `float` `clear` `text-align` `vertical-align` properties that I was using for positioning.

Later when I moved to a new organization, there were no such restrictions. All I had to do was make the web pages load faster and look good on all devices and browsers. Then I took interest in `flexbox`. I almost use all the flex properties regularly and they are stored in my mind as a fresh copy. This shift in my work environment was akin to my experience when I moved from [Vim to Neovim](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/vim-experience-nvim-dev-experience/).

Even when I was working with flexbox, I always looked up to CSS Grids as something awesome. Every time I try to learn/read and understand it, I would get bored or screw up my understanding. But now, after eons, I guess I've finally cracked up the mystery behind CSS Grids.

Recently, I played a game that has like 80 levels in it, which progressively teaches you about CSS grids. It took me 3 days to complete all the levels. I played it during my leisure time, it was fun. Thanks to the creator. You can give it a try, it's interesting. This game reminded me of the [time I used Gatsby and GitHub Actions to create faster builds](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/gatsby-incremental-faster-builds-github-actions/).

## Do we need media queries? I guess not.
There are functions in CSS!! Yes, you heard me - functions! What if I told you that you are already using them!? Yes, `rgb()`, `rgba()`, `hsl()`, `calc()`, etc all these are CSS functions. Grids introduce few new functions to use `repeat()`and `minmax()`. This concept of functions in CSS is no different from the time I learned about [Computed State in React](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/computed-state-in-react).

### WTH is `minmax()`?
With `minmax()` we can avoid writing media queries and breakpoints. All you have to do is define a minimum width and a maximum width for your grid cells. The rest would be taken care of by CSS.

`minmax(minimum-value, max-value)`
The values can be any of these `px`, `%`, `fr`, `min-content`, `max-content`.  Alright, we have talked a lot about CSS and grids. Let's see some code.

## Tile layout
Previously, tile layout was difficult and we had to write a bunch of CSS code. Now with grid, it has become a breeze. I use the CSS grid for my [blog listing page](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/). Do check it out! You might also want to check out [this article on Coding Standards with TypeScript and Husky](https://samuellawrentz.com/blog/coding-standards-husky-typescript-lint-staged).

```css
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-gap: 15px;
  // auto-fit takes care of the number of columns it can fit into
  // the given space
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  grid-auto-rows: 200px;
  grid-auto-flow: dense;
}
```
## Breaking down into bits
Okay, let me break down the above style into some readable components
 - `display: grid`
	Obviously, This is required.
 - `grid-gap:15px`
	This is used to define a gap between the grid cells. Forget about margins. If it is a grid, we use `gap` or `grid-gap`
 - `grid-template-columns`
	This is used to define the blueprint of the grid columns - describes how many columns and the width of each column.
 - `repeat()` 
 As mentioned earlier, this is a CSS function, that repeats whatever is passed as a 2nd argument for the number of times passed in the 1st argument.
 - `auto-fit` 
 Calculates the number of columns that need to be generated based on the specified width.
 - `minmax()`
 This also is a CSS function, we've already covered it above.
 - `grid-auto-rows`
 This property defines a standard height for the rows so that you don't have to specify explicit heights.
 - `grid-auto-flow`
 This property is used to specify the algorithm that is used to fill the grid. By default it is `row`. `dense` fills the gap with smaller items wherever possible. This makes the grid look dense.
